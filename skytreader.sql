I&#8217;m very happy that last Lantern Parade is indeed my last (as an undergraduate student of Computer Science, at least). And I&#8217;m more than happy to have graduated on time despite more than a few hitches in my trip.</p>\n<p>For two consecutive days I braved the heat of graduation ceremonies in a <i>barong tagalog</i>. It was, after all, for these ceremonies that I shared with my fellow (ex-?)students that I swallowed the unfair mismanagement of our undergraduate research project. But everyday I wake up after being judged to know, ummmm, &#8220;BS Computer Science&#8221;, I am always reminded that the ceremonies didn&#8217;t matter and were but mere formalities. It was the gradual steps we took towards graduation which (hopefully) made us deserving of what they conferred on us.</p>\n<p>I almost found myself crying after receiving my diploma that I found it difficult to smile for the photographs. Finally, after four years, I get to clean my room and my computer of all the accumulated &#8220;proofs of passing&#8221; I&#8217;ve been saving as a contingency plan, in case some disputes about my grades arise in the near future. Even right now, it is with great awe that I behold my passing grades in Discrete Math and Physics 72. Well, you never know.</p>\n<p>And because, thank thesis, it&#8217;s been over two months since I last posted here, I&#8217;m still too lazy to give anything coherent; I&#8217;m still catching up on missed sleep, missed games, and missed personal projects. So we eat up the rest of the space with my tips on how to make living on this rock we call the Earth a worthwhile endeavor.</p>\n<p><strong>Read books.</strong> Seriously. And I don&#8217;t just mean that you meticulously read ahead of this week&#8217;s lecture at school. I mean to say that you go out of your way and find books that will take you to worlds undiscovered and will bring you thoughts to ponder. The human civilization may be young compared to some alien culture lurking just behind the neighboring galaxies but we have already accumulated quite a trove of wisdom and almost all of them are recorded in books.</p>\n<p>Almost.</p>\n<p><strong>Have real-life adventures.</strong> Travel when and where you can. Take unknown paths. Do things without always knowing how they&#8217;ll turn out. This is how you&#8217;ll accumulate wisdom for yourself. You&#8217;ll surely be missing out a lot if you don&#8217;t read books but never ever forget that your life is one huge book-in-the-works as well and it will be such a shame to look back one day, realizing that your book is empty or well-written but unread. I am pleased to say that during my four years at college I&#8217;ve had my fair share of these adventures. Wish I took more field trips, though. I&#8217;m looking forward for more.</p>\n<p><strong>Make mistakes.</strong> Waste your time. You&#8217;ll thank yourself for it. If that book you are writing isn&#8217;t full of erasures you are most probably not trying out a lot of things. Don&#8217;t follow tried-and-tested recipes. That is not how you&#8217;ll learn.</p>\n<p><strong>Be aware of what you don&#8217;t know.</strong> And I assure you this will save your skin. And the skin of the people tossed with you in this adventure. Being aware of what you don&#8217;t know will help you make sense of your mistakes. You will be better prepared next time. Hallelujah to the things we don&#8217;t know.</p>\n<p>And lastly,</p>\n<p><strong>Do not listen to every advice thrown your way.</strong> I have come to accept that life, unlike research, does not require a theoretical framework for you to move forward. All you need is some nerve and, believe you me, you will be surprised how often this Universe/Fate/Destiny/Karma/God rewards raw nerve. Not always, but more often than what other people will have you believe. It is alright to just make things up as you go. No one will take it against you.</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:63:"http://localhost/skytreader.net/journal/for-what-its-worth/feed";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:54:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:19:"Palawan Photography";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"http://localhost/skytreader.net/journal/palawan-photography";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"http://localhost/skytreader.net/journal/palawan-photography#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 29 Jan 2012 08:39:05 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Photography";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"adventures";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:19:"alliterations again";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"palawan";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"paradise";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37:"http://localhost/skytreader.net/?p=24";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:457:"The waves rock our boat, turning our reef-hopping trip to an amusement-park feel joyride of sorts.

An island, sun-soaked for everyone to see its lush, appears on the horizon. I take aim with my lens but, as I make sure that I have set the proper shutter speed to negate the wildness of waves, I acknowledge that, for the first time, my camera has proved insufficient for this adventure.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. My camera performed as admirably as ever, taking shots as sharp as usual, limited only by the hands and eyes wielding it. But, as all cameras do, it could not record the feelings that made the trip impressible in memory. True, it recorded the beauty I saw of Palawan but it cannot capture the smell of adventure as we battled the waves, the flavor of sea-side air, nor that sun soaked smell served as my perfume for almost the whole time we stayed there.</p>\n<p>I got into Palawan courtesy of the undergraduate research I am doing. Our project, Porites recognition, is part of a larger project in UPD. The researchers involved in the project went to Palawan to gather data. My role isn&#8217;t really field-related but I got included anyway.</p>\n<p>Despite it being a research trip, it was adventure all throughout, from the waves to the food to the exploration of the city&#8217;s night spirit. The first day we rocked the waves, we ran short of fuel. We waited on a sandbar for further instructions. It&#8217;s beautiful, dreamy in quality, if not for the fact that it is a graveyard of corals damaged by dynamites. It is a peaceful spot in the middle of the sea nonetheless, as the resting place of innocent creatures should be.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Stranded" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6774873597/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Stranded" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7165/6774873597_773bdec527.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Taking a Respite from the Sea''s Immensity" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6774881245/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Taking a Respite from the Sea''s Immensity" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7026/6774881245_e04da4eb28.jpg" width="500" height="113" /></a></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Abandoned" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6774856303/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Abandoned" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7159/6774856303_a82364662b.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\n<p>I tried to travel as light as possible being that (1) it is generally a good idea to travel light, (2) pretty men travel light and (3) I did not want too much of my personal stuff to get in the way of the research equipment we brought along. As such I took a leap of faith and didn&#8217;t bring any medium to back up my photographs and I was too lazy and too much of a cheapskate to invest in a memory card more or two, to distribute my photographs across. It would&#8217;ve been fine until they took a fancy to my camera and I became an official photodocumanitarian of sorts.</p>\n<p>I got all my pictures back to Manila safe and sound but I learned a valuable lesson nonetheless: the pictures I take belong to the people who made the shot, whether they are distinguishable/included or not in the final output, as much as it belongs to me. I should&#8217;ve been more responsible for our shared property. In my lapse of judgment I didn&#8217;t act like a photographer, even for a hobbyist, not even like the computer scientist I am trained as.</p>\n<p>I am grateful for the trip.

And it was starting to get dark.

Not unless you have your own lighting equipment. But (a) I don&#8217;t have that and (b) that looks too out-of-place, space-taking, and inconsiderate for an event like the Lantern Parade.</li>\n<li>Unlike a point-and-shoot&#8217;s flash, which fires the lights straight at your subject, an SLR fires flash upwards, assuming there is a ceiling to bounce the light downwards, diffused. This results to a better effect/less glare. There obviously isn&#8217;t a ceiling equivalent in <i>outdoors</i>, Lanter Parade set-up. I had to use my hands to direct the flash to my subjects (hood it over the flash like a &#8220;ceiling&#8221; which will quickly catch the lights and bounce it towards your subject). Thank goodness I realized this quickly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, as it was getting dark at this point, it became harder to get decent shots. Lighting was no longer on my side as I was already relying on flash. Otherwise, it&#8217;d be too dark or too orange depending on where I decide to shoot.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Wall-E" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526288615/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Wall-E" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7169/6526288615_149dd71673.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\n<p><a title="The DCS contingent" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526300709/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="The DCS contingent" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7142/6526300709_5753471da0.jpg" /></a></p>\n<div>Above pictured is Eng&#8217;g''s Wall-E, one of our lanterns, and the DCS/Cursor contingent of the Parade. Like last year, Eng&#8217;g scored with a particularly awesomazing lantern followed by a—wait for it—<i><b>boring</b></i> march of Eng&#8217;g orgs and banners. My sister, who majors in Broadcast Communication, likens it to <i>dead air</i> i.e., awkward and should-be-avoided pauses in radio productions. Unlike the last three years though, they, at least, weren&#8217;t wearing orange. Plus points for the fashion factor!</div>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Belly Dancers 1" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526312523/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Belly Dancers 1" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7165/6526312523_3940c75595.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\n<p><a title="Belly Dancers 2" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526328455/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Belly Dancers 2" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7002/6526328455_0f3c95ee95.jpg" /></a></p>\n<p><a title="The Fire" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526335201/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="The Fire" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7016/6526335201_9315e7c980.jpg" /></a></p>\n<div>I took this shot from one of the torches of the Beta Sigma frat men. Their first number was the human chain/snake which I believe is part of their initiation rights. Even if it is my second time seeing this, it was still kind of chilling especially with their chant. I heard someone (was he from βσ?) call their second part <i>kata</i> which is the Karate equivalent of Taekwondo&#8217;s <i>poomsae</i> or forms. While their formation and synchronicity might look watch-worthy, it didn&#8217;t really catch my attention (maybe &#8217;cause I&#8217;ve seen better during my TKD days). So, my eyes were wandering off to better photo-ops, their torch flames in particular. It, however, amuses me that Beta Sigma has their own blend of martial arts.</div>\n<p>A few more lanterns and it was finally the turn of my most anticipated college ever.

Brock was making rice cakes when Ash noticed a camera lens (wanting to take a picture of Pikachu) appear from behind some bushes. He over-reacted, imagining it to fire a laser projectile of sorts, and ruined their little rice cake picnic. I&#8217;ve never been able to shake that episode from my mind since I watched it as a kid.</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"http://localhost/skytreader.net/journal/lovely-lantern-lights/feed";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:54:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:23:"The Last One, Hopefully";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"http://localhost/skytreader.net/journal/the-last-one-hopefully";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"http://localhost/skytreader.net/journal/the-last-one-hopefully#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 30 Nov 2011 18:35:41 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Reflections";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"UP Life";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"beginnings";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"lookbacks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"yes the jason mraz is that awesome";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37:"http://localhost/skytreader.net/?p=60";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:508:"Second semesters.

I had to recharge by doing nothing and watching my first concert ever, starred by the Jason Mraz.</p>\n<p>An amusing aspect of this second semester is how I encounter my past teachers. Imagine casually meeting your first math teacher in college ever, remembering that his subject was your baptism by fire, and wondering if he remembers you or if you should maybe greet or wave or something. Even after Math 17 I didn&#8217;t really become that awesome in math. But, if anything, Math 17 gave me the tenacity I&#8217;d use during those countless times I went on the brink of failure. I still have to encounter a non-theoretical application of the complex plane, numeric progressions, and root finding but Math 17 was most worthwhile taking even if just for the mindset I gained.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s only been four years and yet it all seems so long. Maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve actually had eight sets of subjects just for the past four years? And that&#8217;s not counting my summer semesters.</p>\n<p>Another amusement: my candidate last semester is host to a number of firsts in my life. It is my first underloaded semester, being that all those summers spent in school has finally paid off and I&#8217;m only 13 units away from my diploma (15 to around 21 is the range of normal load, variable depending on whether you have laboratory units). But wait, no, it is also my first semester taking a Master&#8217;s class. Out of curiousity and a desire not to slack off/underload, I added a further three units to the missing 13 units of my undergraduate curriculum.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m closer than ever to closing this volume of my life, but it&#8217;s not a clear coast yet. I still have an obstacle course and a thesis to finish. But hey I&#8217;m already here. So just you wait.</p>\n<p>See you!</p>\n<p>P.S. Greet the blog a happy birthday!

I&#8217;ll miss your compact feel, how I can carry you everyday, except when my bag is too crowded already.</div>\n<p>I&#8217;m not really a fan of anime but I&#8217;m quite a huge fan of BLEACH!. Those who know their BLEACH! will know from where did I pattern the name &#8220;Getsurikai&#8221;. It isn&#8217;t very clean Japanese from what I&#8217;ve been told but hey, I like the sound of it so I&#8217;m taking artistic license. And oh, it literally means &#8220;moon grasp&#8221; by the way.</p>\n<p>These past few days, I&#8217;ve been busy trying to get the feel for it. So far, the biggest adjustment I had to make is the placement of controls. Whereas my old Kodak has all controls at the right-hand side, Getsurikai has it both in the left and right-hand side. Kodak has its shooting mode settings on a dial around the shutter button but that is where Getsurikai has its on/off switch, the shooting modes being in a dial at the left of the viewfinder. Imagine what happened the first time I (instinctively) tried to switch modes? Hooha.</p>\n<p>But I quickly got over that problem and I&#8217;m pretty comfortable with where all the controls are located now. What I&#8217;m currently doing is trying to learn all its features before December&#8217;s <a title="Year Three" href="http://localhost/skytreader.net/journal/year-three">Lantern Parade</a>, which is, if you need to be made aware, a photographer&#8217;s idea of a shooting feast.</p>\n<p>They&#8217;re not much yet but here are some of the results of my test drive.</p>\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a title="Aperture Experiments" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6275215021/" target="_blank"><img alt="Aperture Experiments" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6060/6275215021_cbaeea313b.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Just experimenting with aperture settings&#8230;</p></div>\n<div></div>\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a title="Art Found" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6275221317/" target="_blank"><img alt="Art Found" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6035/6275221317_8dc8fc821e.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Art found in the construction.

I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s up with CSSP this year but they seem to be in a particularly celebratory mood; they even had sportsfests and pageants (a la Miss Eng&#8217;g, in my opinion) this year. Whatever the celebration may be, cheers to them.</p>\n<p>See those crayons? They melted thanks to the rain, so unlike real crayons which melts with fire, not water.</p>\n</div>\n<p><a title="Pouncing Zebra" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5270538088/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Pouncing Zebra" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5168/5270538088_9ee1c0ec79.jpg" /></a></p>\n<div><b>Aside:</b> This zebra is so cute. There were other balloons of this kind there, from SpongeBob to Dora, but I only managed to take the picture of this zebra.

Here are some more shots (whose lighting I like but are not very favored with my sister in terms of the cuteness factor).</div>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5271447817/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5247/5271447817_2f5eab0d1b.jpg" /></a></p>\n<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5271440689/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5168/5271440689_4dd35807d6.jpg" /></a></p>\n<p>An early show stealer is our very own Pep Squad.

I think some of them was more driven by ideology than by art.</p>\n<p>Engineering&#8212;my college&#8212;was a big let down, I&#8217;m afraid. It started with a particularly crowd-whoa-drawing contraption which looked like a horse&#8217;s skeleton with a rider too small for it at the top. Then the rider pedals the bike and the contraption moves and the crowd is amazed. It was followed by electronic (read: Earth-friendly) jeepneys. And then a long march of Engineering organizations which didn&#8217;t display anything much aside from orange shirts courtesy of Meralco and org banners.</p>\n<p>Upon entering UP, our Dean then told us the story behind our College&#8217;s Lantern Parade performance. There was a time when no one gave much damn on our lantern. Then she gave the ultimatum that, if our Lantern Parade performance remains lackluster, Eng&#8217;g Week* won&#8217;t be held next year. And the rest is, as they say, history. I don&#8217;t know how true this story is, me being unaffliated, but I think it is time to amend that order to something that will require the orgs to show something worth watching. Just my two cents.</p>\n<p>Anyway, we jump to the show stealers of always, the ever-awesome College of Fine Arts.</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t help but feel that their parade is shorter than usual this year. I didn&#8217;t see any of the people I know in Fine Arts.

Back in those days when I spent the day beeping on my high-tech Tamagochi that is Pokemon in the GameBoy Color, I&#8217;m not really a very huge Blastoise (or, for that matter, water-type) fan. I&#8217;m more the fire type kind of trainer. When Oak/Elm asks me to choose, I always chose Charmander/Cyndaquil which eventually evolves to Charizard/Typhloshion. And then my rival will choose the water-type, Squirtle/Totodile, which grows to Blastoise/Feraligatr. And you know what? I always beat my rival despite the type advantage. I always hard-boiled Squirtle/Wartortle/Blastoise in his shell. Even if he beats me, I&#8217;d turn the GameBoy off without saving so that my loss is technically non-existent. Then I&#8217;d turn it back on and train some more before having another go at cooking some hard-boiled pokemon. Now you know why I wouldn&#8217;t like King Blastoise to know.</p>\n<p><a title="Gyarados Cometh!" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5270528474/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Gyarados Cometh!" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5161/5270528474_e6bd85cc68.jpg" /></a></p>\n<div>You didn&#8217;t tell King Blastoise?

I still recall singing the energy out of <em>Make It Mine</em> after grueling sessions from the best CS11 class ever. <em>Details in the Fabric</em> calmed my nerves after my skirmish that is Math17.</p>\n<p>It was a good album all in all; I ripped 8 out of the 12 songs included into my playlist. After all, it had <em>I&#8217;m Yours</em>, which took <a href="http://craptaker.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Rona</a>, and also <em>Love for a Child</em> which is a very nice song from the onset to the moment you finally listen to the lyrics. It also had the bestest <em>torpe</em> song I&#8217;ve heard so far in the form of <em>If It Kills Me</em>. And most of all, it had <em>A Beautiful Mess</em>.</p>\n<p><em>A Beautiful Mess</em> is a very nice song to sing right but very disastrous to get wrong (largely because its large fanbase will make you pay for your murder). It has a certain kind of poetry to it, one that makes you pause and feel the moment the notes and words register into your gray matter. I remember describing it to my sister as soundtrack-esque, meaning, I find it a song very fitting to play as the closing credits of a cathartic movie rolls. But I&#8217;ve said too much; I might be boring you.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been a fan of <em>A Beautiful Mess</em> for two years now and it is only recently that I&#8217;ve made sense of its message. I&#8217;ve always thought it was about how life isn&#8217;t perfect but because you are here it is the best of all possible worlds. I now find that interpretation a little off mark.</p>\n<p>It is about relationships.</p>\n<p>It is about being you and I and we all at the same time. No matter how messy things may get, it is still beautiful by the mere fact that here we are, related by things so simple you&#8217;d find it stupid they can connect people at all; things like smiles and greetings and back-slaps and high fives and kisses. We. Indeed, tides may turn and hearts disfigure but that&#8217;s of no concern when we are wounded together. Now I know why that line moves me so.</p>\n<p>I am reminded that beauty is something you choose to see and create much like how love is something you choose to be. It seems to me that life is made up of choices, even in the most mundane of things. We are related because we chose to be in this together not because the gods wanted us to be. Things have always been up to us.</p>\n<p>Wherever you may find yourself this coming rainy season, I hope you&#8217;d find yourself able to believe that the sun still waits behind the clouds. Or, if you aren&#8217;t really feeling very sympathetic towards the sun especially after his summer wave, why not put your umbrella down and dance in the rain? Across rocks and imaginary boundaries I&#8217;ll be dancing with you.</p>\n<p>And do yourself a favor and be Mrazmerized by a performance of <em>A Beautiful Mess</em>. Here are my favorites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKtv4GR8M-8">A Beautiful Mess @ Royal Albert Hall</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch#!v=AKanbidzvUQ&amp;feature=related">A Beautiful Mess @ Nobel Peace Prize Concert</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MXLCB-4ncs&amp;NR=1">Rip-off from the Live DVD <em>Jason Mraz&#8217;s Beautiful Mess &#8211; Live on Earth</em></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The rip-off from <em>Live on Earth</em> has the best quality among the three and the one from Royal Albert Hall has the lowest (it is but a bootleg). Nonetheless, I enjoyed the one from Royal Albert Hall the most. That performance has this tendency to make me feel empty and filled at the same time. <a href="http://freshnessfactorfivethousand.blogspot.com/2008/09/morning-after_27.html">It even moved Jason Mraz to tears</a>. The one from Nobel has him singing alongside a full orchestra, which in my opinion, magnifies the catharsis inspired by the song. Much like in relationships, beauty, and love, the choice is yours. Watch none, watch one, watch all or search YouTube for your own favorite. Again, the choice is yours.</p>\n<p>Namaste,<br />\nYour Skymeister</p>\n<p>P.S.

The only way I could&#8217;ve cleaned myself (even partially) entailed going through the cold caress of mountain water. This is adventure indeed, the kind catterpillars sadly forget as they become butterflies.</p>\n<p>My muscles are aching as I type like I worked out for a whole month straight without even a few seconds of water break anywhere in between. But the ache reminds me of a good two nights and two days spent in the cradle of Maria Makiling. Clearly, this is the welcome kind of muscle ache, one that is the sign not of deteriorating health but of a life lived in two-days&#8217; worth of adventure. I&#8217;m both glad and sad that they&#8217;d be gone in a few days. How I&#8217;d miss this feeling and the kind of joy the experience brought me. I feel that I&#8217;ve lived life, for two nights and two days, as the experience took my breath away.</p>\n<p>Before I delve into the fun of reliving the adventure allow me first to wish my left shoe a very solemn &#8220;Rest In Peace&#8221;. You have been loyal to me for the past two years or so my dear friend, going through mud and shine, opening your mouth that protects the fingertips of my left foot eventually but not making a single sound of complaint. Your twin, right shoe, will have to rest as well, now that you are gone. I regret that he won&#8217;t be able to do it in the house though, as we are pretty crowded already.</p>\n<p>My left shoe died an honorable death, in the midst of adventure, as I spent the good part of last weekend jumping through rocks and grabbing various plants for dear life, double checking in a hurried fashion beforehand that it is without thorns and that it is not actually some camouflaging fauna. It died last Saturday but I had to abuse it further by using it again for the same purposes the next day after last Saturday which is last Sunday. My vocal chords nearly died as well, as I screamed cheers and whoa&#8217;s in flow with my group&#8217;s collective effervescence.</p>\n<p>And as I know that general allusions to the experience will do the adventure no justice, allow me to compress about two days&#8217; worth of story in a single web page, as I try to set the record for the longest blog post ever. Right. Let the stories start.</p>\n<p><b>Table of Contents</b><br />\n<a href="#day1">Laying Down Ground</a> | <a href="#day2">The Trek</a> | <a href="#day3">Running Again, Some Swimming, and Goodbye Finally</a></p>\n<p><a id="day1" name="day1"></a></p>\n<p>Laying Down Ground<br />\nFriday, February 5, 2010, Deep Evening</p>\n<p>Tired and exhausted from last night&#8217;s academic cramming as well as from the day that passed, I stepped off the bus and was readily greeted by Orion. Arr hunter, I say. Thanks for the greeting as I am here not to choose the events that will happen but to let the adventure choose me. Be my guide.</p>\n<p>For the good part of the night we tried to make the provided tents as cozy as possible. Evidently, a man&#8217;s idea of &#8220;cozy&#8221; is way different from a woman&#8217;s. A tent is capable of holding six people but seven of us had to share, plus a few battalion of ants. I brought some mosquito repellent but I&#8217;m totally unprepared for these warriors, biting us violently for entering the critical zone of their territory. And we had our luggage with us too, taking up a generous part of our already-cramped tent. I remember being told once that pretty men travel light. If that is true, then Maria Makiling won&#8217;t be dating any of us by default.</p>\n<p>We were briefed of what awaits us. I didn&#8217;t hear anything save for the word &#8220;exciting&#8221;. After about an hour of planning we embark for slumber land and I felt the rough contours of the earth against my back. Adventure here we go!</p>\n<p><a id="day2" name="day2"></a></p>\n<p>The Trek<br />\nSaturday, February 6, 2010, Morning to Mid-Afternoon, and then whole day</p>\n<p>We rose before the sun to prepare for what lies in store for the day. This is the first time we&#8217;ll be actually cooking and, incidentally, my stomach&#8217;s been lucky enough to have a choice between two culinary sets so that if something goes wrong here, I always have the other group for back-up. It&#8217;s a long and complicated story of how come there were two groups but in any case, the two groups merged into one later on, forming what can be considered as our main class, plus a few additions.</p>\n<p>And yes, pictures&#8230;</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Rappel Instructors" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4343350242/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Rappel Instructors" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4040/4343350242_589eba91f6_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\n<div>As you see, it was still pretty dark when we started cooking that I cannot rely on natural lighting and I had to resort to flash.

I was wrong. The trek found me with my shirt glued wet by perspiration on my back. I found myself finally appreciating Gatorade and thanking AJ for lending me a cap. The trail was beautiful, green and overflowing with flora, ripe for some shots. Unfortunately, my hands had been busy looking for firm features to hold on to and breaking the momentum I gain as my feet followed the dictates of the natural laws of inclined planes, too tired to resist. This is where my left shoe died, in service, ever loyal.</p>\n<p>That all said, I still managed to take some pictures while trekking.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Dyan and Che, with a flower they find pretty" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4346422384/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Dyan and Che, with a flower they find pretty" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4014/4346422384_f989f424ce_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\n<div>Dyan and Che, with a flower they find pretty</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Don''t faeries bathe in here?" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4346424596/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Don''t faeries bathe in here?" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2613/4346424596_e70800d5b4_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\n<div>Don&#8217;t faeries bathe in here?</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4345683253/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4012/4345683253_cf3dd128e1_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\n<div>Taken just before we stopped to eat packed lunch live at the trail.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4346429276/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2767/4346429276_02f68a8958_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\n<div>Ging and Baki.

Taken by Dyan.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Returning to camp, I found myself slumped dead near the entrance of our tent, not minding the heat, nor the flies buzzing around, nor the ants who seem addicted to my shirtless torso. I know not how many miles we walked nor how high a height we reached. I did not take a bath immediately which was lucky because our group had someone to sprawl on the ground when we were taught how to rescue someone down in a cliff with a possible spine injury.</p>\n<p>Darkness bit the skies again and soon we were cooking and eating by flashlight. It&#8217;s such a shame we were not able to light a bonfire because all the firewood around can only be found along the trail, and our own legs might just kick ourselves in protest if ever we plan to return there just to gather some firewood.</p>\n<p><a id="day3" name="day3"></a></p>\n<p>Running Again, Some Swimming, and Goodbye Finally<br />\nSunday, February 7, 2010, Morning to Mid-Afternoon</p>\n<p>AJ and me woke up at around 4AM. Being one of the two group leaders, AJ spent sometime going around the tents of our group, retrieving their consciousness from slumber. A few minutes into the activity and we were entertained by someone&#8217;s semi-consciousness and made-up terms courtesy of the spirit that is alcohol: <i>&#8220;Lutuin na yang mga AJ na yan!&#8221;</i> (Cook those AJ&#8217;s now!), and, <i>&#8220;Lagyan ng isang metrong wetness yung shroup&#8221;</i> (Add a meter of wetness to the shroup), she&#8217;s been saying (yes she&#8217;s a she). We laughed our heads off from that episode for about a couple of hours, until the person concerned regained full control of her consciousness and&#8230;you should&#8217;ve seen her face.</p>\n<p>I spent two hours doing nothing but walking around and eating breakfast, breathing fresh mountain air. It feels and sounds so bummer to relate that I ate instant noodles on a moment as fresh as that. Instant noodles is the only junk food that remains in my system after all. I&#8217;ve kicked my addiction to soft drinks and cheesy potato chips but not to instant noodles. Note, however, that I suggested, before Saturday&#8217;s adventure, that we hunt for snakes along the trail so that we&#8217;ll have something to cook in camp&#8211;a suggestion that was met with yeah-right faces from my groupmates.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Breakfast at Camp" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4347544313/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Breakfast at Camp" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2777/4347544313_ee9d376f13_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\n<div>Sunday morning breakfast at camp.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sunday&#8217;s most anticipated activity is map navigation, an activity very similar to trekking sans the almost-vertical slopes, packed lunch, and instructor guides but with a lot of competition, a lot of tasks and a single compass. I cannot decide what is more memorable between the trek and map nav. They&#8217;ll most probably tie. The trek is memorable because of the ooh&#8217;s and wow&#8217;s generated by nature&#8217;s beauty; map nav, on the other hand, is memorable due to all the adrenaline and willpower involved. We were so competitive in map nav that I really wasn&#8217;t able to take any pictures.</p>\n<p>We were misguided and so we were lost for about a good half an hour. Nonetheless, we returned first in camp and you can only imagine with what euphoria did we tread around the still-empty tents, willpower being replaced by effervescence and cheers. Unfortunately, we didn&#8217;t win Best in Navigation because start times are not the same for all groups and so there are some chronological translation involved.</p>\n<p>After lunch, some refreshments, and a few hours&#8217; rest, we proceeded to the pool to cross about 100 meters, with an optional break after meter 50. Not the most anticipated activity because swimming isn&#8217;t really something you&#8217;d learn in a few meetings. At this point, I would like to thank one instructor who gave me some last-moment pointers on how to conquer water.

Later on, you sit in front of your computer and blog about the whole running-to-and-fro-to-get-pictures business and realize that it was such a tiring experience if not for the people-adrenaline that kept you up. People will never cease to amaze you, indeed. Surround yourself with them, in their own terms.</p>\n<p>Digicams are also nice and amazing. In an age of instant things, this is one of the few that really piqued my interest. Fortunately, unlike last year, I did not forget to bring my camera along with me.

This guy is just one of the many. Fine Arts makes me drool with envy. You got talent I can only dream of.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ever since I was kid I wanted to draw. I remember, back in the days when both my parents worked, they&#8217;d leave me with a sheet of bond paper and an 8-piece pack of crayons before going to work. I&#8217;d spend all those material resources drawing. I always ended up drawing circles, although in circumspect, with all my geometric/mathematical training, they were more oblongs than circles. Everyday I&#8217;d resolve to do something not so <i>circly</i>, to no avail. I think it&#8217;s hardcoded in my genes, drawing circles. My whole childhood art (self-)education ran in circles, with me drawing oblongs.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I&#8217;d exchange pencils, colors and papers for computers and digicams.

As such I took a leap of faith and didn''t bring any medium to back up my photographs and I was too lazy and too much of a cheapskate to invest in a memory card more or two, to distribute my photographs across. It would''ve been fine until they took a fancy to my camera and I became an official photodocumanitarian of sorts.\n\nI got all my pictures back to Manila safe and sound but I learned a valuable lesson nonetheless: the pictures I take belong to the people who made the shot, whether they are distinguishable/included or not in the final output, as much as it belongs to me. I should''ve been more responsible for our shared property. In my lapse of judgment I didn''t act like a photographer, even for a hobbyist, not even like the computer scientist I am trained as.\n\nI am grateful for the trip. I am grateful for the adventure; heck, the <a href="http://skytreader.net/journal/meeting-maria">last one</a> I had was almost two years ago.

I was wrong. The trek found me with my shirt glued wet by perspiration on my back. I found myself finally appreciating Gatorade and thanking AJ for lending me a cap. The trail was beautiful, green and overflowing with flora, ripe for some shots. Unfortunately, my hands had been busy looking for firm features to hold on to and breaking the momentum I gain as my feet followed the dictates of the natural laws of inclined planes, too tired to resist. This is where my left shoe died, in service, ever loyal.\r\n\r\nThat all said, I still managed to take some pictures while trekking.\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Dyan and Che, with a flower they find pretty" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4346422384/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Dyan and Che, with a flower they find pretty" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4014/4346422384_f989f424ce_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>Dyan and Che, with a flower they find pretty</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Don''t faeries bathe in here?" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4346424596/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Don''t faeries bathe in here?" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2613/4346424596_e70800d5b4_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>Don''t faeries bathe in here?</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4345683253/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4012/4345683253_cf3dd128e1_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>Taken just before we stopped to eat packed lunch live at the trail.</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4346429276/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2767/4346429276_02f68a8958_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>Ging and Baki.

Taken by Dyan.</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nReturning to camp, I found myself slumped dead near the entrance of our tent, not minding the heat, nor the flies buzzing around, nor the ants who seem addicted to my shirtless torso. I know not how many miles we walked nor how high a height we reached. I did not take a bath immediately which was lucky because our group had someone to sprawl on the ground when we were taught how to rescue someone down in a cliff with a possible spine injury.\r\n\r\nDarkness bit the skies again and soon we were cooking and eating by flashlight. It''s such a shame we were not able to light a bonfire because all the firewood around can only be found along the trail, and our own legs might just kick ourselves in protest if ever we plan to return there just to gather some firewood.\r\n\r\n<a id="day3" name="day3"></a>\r\n\r\nRunning Again, Some Swimming, and Goodbye Finally\r\nSunday, February 7, 2010, Morning to Mid-Afternoon\r\n\r\nAJ and me woke up at around 4AM. Being one of the two group leaders, AJ spent sometime going around the tents of our group, retrieving their consciousness from slumber. A few minutes into the activity and we were entertained by someone''s semi-consciousness and made-up terms courtesy of the spirit that is alcohol: <i>"Lutuin na yang mga AJ na yan!"</i> (Cook those AJ''s now!), and, <i>"Lagyan ng isang metrong wetness yung shroup"</i> (Add a meter of wetness to the shroup), she''s been saying (yes she''s a she). We laughed our heads off from that episode for about a couple of hours, until the person concerned regained full control of her consciousness and...you should''ve seen her face.\r\n\r\nI spent two hours doing nothing but walking around and eating breakfast, breathing fresh mountain air. It feels and sounds so bummer to relate that I ate instant noodles on a moment as fresh as that. Instant noodles is the only junk food that remains in my system after all. I''ve kicked my addiction to soft drinks and cheesy potato chips but not to instant noodles. Note, however, that I suggested, before Saturday''s adventure, that we hunt for snakes along the trail so that we''ll have something to cook in camp--a suggestion that was met with yeah-right faces from my groupmates.\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Breakfast at Camp" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4347544313/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Breakfast at Camp" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2777/4347544313_ee9d376f13_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>Sunday morning breakfast at camp.</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSunday''s most anticipated activity is map navigation, an activity very similar to trekking sans the almost-vertical slopes, packed lunch, and instructor guides but with a lot of competition, a lot of tasks and a single compass. I cannot decide what is more memorable between the trek and map nav. They''ll most probably tie. The trek is memorable because of the ooh''s and wow''s generated by nature''s beauty; map nav, on the other hand, is memorable due to all the adrenaline and willpower involved. We were so competitive in map nav that I really wasn''t able to take any pictures.\r\n\r\nWe were misguided and so we were lost for about a good half an hour. Nonetheless, we returned first in camp and you can only imagine with what euphoria did we tread around the still-empty tents, willpower being replaced by effervescence and cheers. Unfortunately, we didn''t win Best in Navigation because start times are not the same for all groups and so there are some chronological translation involved.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch, some refreshments, and a few hours'' rest, we proceeded to the pool to cross about 100 meters, with an optional break after meter 50. Not the most anticipated activity because swimming isn''t really something you''d learn in a few meetings. At this point, I would like to thank one instructor who gave me some last-moment pointers on how to conquer water. It''s thanks to him I crossed 50 at my first try and almost made it to 100 at the second one. I am most grateful.\r\n\r\nAnd what did our group get after this whole adventure? Aside from bonding moments, we got also got this,\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Best Group" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4348344160/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Best Group" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4045/4348344160_4fe35d4847_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>Best in Navigation went to the group who made their way past all the tasks and points fastest; it does not necessarily mean that they did the tasks best. Best Group, on the other hand, went to the group who did everything best; since they are best in everything, it also means that they have the best time in navigation (it need not be stated since it is already implied). Quod Erat Demonstrandum. That I want to show.</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt''s been fun and I am thankful for this adventure, this opportunity to bond with nature and other people. I didn''t travel light but I guess Maria Makiling still dated me. I saw her beauty and I hope I''ve been the gentleman Nature deserves. In about two days I''ve seen cliffs, walked a forest and drank mountain water--lived all my boyhood dreams, in short. After such an experience, it feels so bummer to say "Damn! I have a Calculus exam this Saturday and a Data Structures exam this Monday".\r\n\r\nI shall not forget, the day I met Maria.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<hr noshade="noshade" />\r\n\r\n<b>Colophon:</b> I keep on saying that the adventure lasted for <i>about two days</i> when my story is divided into three chapters.

I know not how many miles we walked nor how high a height we reached. I did not take a bath immediately which was lucky because our group had someone to sprawl on the ground when we were taught how to rescue someone down in a cliff with a possible spine injury.\n\nDarkness bit the skies again and soon we were cooking and eating by flashlight.

Being one of the two group leaders, AJ spent sometime going around the tents of our group, retrieving their consciousness from slumber. A few minutes into the activity and we were entertained by someone''s semi-consciousness and made-up terms courtesy of the spirit that is alcohol: <i>"Lutuin na yang mga AJ na yan!"</i> (Cook those AJ''s now!), and, <i>"Lagyan ng isang metrong wetness yung shroup"</i> (Add a meter of wetness to the shroup), she''s been saying (yes she''s a she). We laughed our heads off from that episode for about a couple of hours, until the person concerned regained full control of her consciousness and...you should''ve seen her face.\n\nI spent two hours doing nothing but walking around and eating breakfast, breathing fresh mountain air. It feels and sounds so bummer to relate that I ate instant noodles on a moment as fresh as that. Instant noodles is the only junk food that remains in my system after all. I''ve kicked my addiction to soft drinks and cheesy potato chips but not to instant noodles. Note, however, that I suggested, before Saturday''s adventure, that we hunt for snakes along the trail so that we''ll have something to cook in camp--a suggestion that was met with yeah-right faces from my groupmates.\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Breakfast at Camp" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4347544313/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Breakfast at Camp" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2777/4347544313_ee9d376f13_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\n\n<div>Sunday morning breakfast at camp.</div>\n&nbsp;\n\nSunday''s most anticipated activity is map navigation, an activity very similar to trekking sans the almost-vertical slopes, packed lunch, and instructor guides but with a lot of competition, a lot of tasks and a single compass. I cannot decide what is more memorable between the trek and map nav. They''ll most probably tie. The trek is memorable because of the ooh''s and wow''s generated by nature''s beauty; map nav, on the other hand, is memorable due to all the adrenaline and willpower involved. We were so competitive in map nav that I really wasn''t able to take any pictures.\n\nWe were misguided and so we were lost for about a good half an hour. Nonetheless, we returned first in camp and you can only imagine with what euphoria did we tread around the still-empty tents, willpower being replaced by effervescence and cheers. Unfortunately, we didn''t win Best in Navigation because start times are not the same for all groups and so there are some chronological translation involved.\n\nAfter lunch, some refreshments, and a few hours'' rest, we proceeded to the pool to cross about 100 meters, with an optional break after meter 50. Not the most anticipated activity because swimming isn''t really something you''d learn in a few meetings. At this point, I would like to thank one instructor who gave me some last-moment pointers on how to conquer water. It''s thanks to him I crossed 50 at my first try and almost made it to 100 at the second one. I am most grateful.\n\nAnd what did our group get after this whole adventure? Aside from bonding moments, we got also got this,\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Best Group" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4348344160/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Best Group" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4045/4348344160_4fe35d4847_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\n\n<div>Best in Navigation went to the group who made their way past all the tasks and points fastest; it does not necessarily mean that they did the tasks best. Best Group, on the other hand, went to the group who did everything best; since they are best in everything, it also means that they have the best time in navigation (it need not be stated since it is already implied). Quod Erat Demonstrandum. That I want to show.</div>\n&nbsp;\n\nIt''s been fun and I am thankful for this adventure, this opportunity to bond with nature and other people. I didn''t travel light but I guess Maria Makiling still dated me. I saw her beauty and I hope I''ve been the gentleman Nature deserves. In about two days I''ve seen cliffs, walked a forest and drank mountain water--lived all my boyhood dreams, in short. After such an experience, it feels so bummer to say "Damn! I have a Calculus exam this Saturday and a Data Structures exam this Monday".\n\nI shall not forget, the day I met Maria.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr noshade="noshade" />\n\n<b>Colophon:</b> I keep on saying that the adventure lasted for <i>about two days</i> when my story is divided into three chapters.

(30, 1, '2012-12-22 08:52:39', '2012-12-22 08:52:39', 'I spent last weekend in the wild, being dirty and sleeping inside cramped messy tents whose temperature fluctuates between cold and scorching hot, depending on what time of the day it is. I brought some mosquito repellent with me, only to find out that I should''ve feared the ants as well. The only way I could''ve cleaned myself (even partially) entailed going through the cold caress of mountain water. This is adventure indeed, the kind catterpillars sadly forget as they become butterflies.\n\nMy muscles are aching as I type like I worked out for a whole month straight without even a few seconds of water break anywhere in between. But the ache reminds me of a good two nights and two days spent in the cradle of Maria Makiling. Clearly, this is the welcome kind of muscle ache, one that is the sign not of deteriorating health but of a life lived in two-days'' worth of adventure. I''m both glad and sad that they''d be gone in a few days. How I''d miss this feeling and the kind of joy the experience brought me. I feel that I''ve lived life, for two nights and two days, as the experience took my breath away.\n\nBefore I delve into the fun of reliving the adventure allow me first to wish my left shoe a very solemn "Rest In Peace". You have been loyal to me for the past two years or so my dear friend, going through mud and shine, opening your mouth that protects the fingertips of my left foot eventually but not making a single sound of complaint. Your twin, right shoe, will have to rest as well, now that you are gone. I regret that he won''t be able to do it in the house though, as we are pretty crowded already.\n\nMy left shoe died an honorable death, in the midst of adventure, as I spent the good part of last weekend jumping through rocks and grabbing various plants for dear life, double checking in a hurried fashion beforehand that it is without thorns and that it is not actually some camouflaging fauna. It died last Saturday but I had to abuse it further by using it again for the same purposes the next day after last Saturday which is last Sunday. My vocal chords nearly died as well, as I screamed cheers and whoa''s in flow with my group''s collective effervescence.\n\nAnd as I know that general allusions to the experience will do the adventure no justice, allow me to compress about two days'' worth of story in a single web page, as I try to set the record for the longest blog post ever. Right. Let the stories start.\n\n<b>Table of Contents</b>\n<a href="http://skytreader.net/journal/meeting-maria#day1">Laying Down Ground</a> | <a href="http://skytreader.net/journal/meeting-maria#day2">The Trek</a> | <a href="http://skytreader.net/journal/meeting-maria#day3">Running Again, Some Swimming, and Goodbye Finally</a>\n\n<a id="day1" name="day1"></a>\n\nLaying Down Ground\nFriday, February 5, 2010, Deep Evening\n\nTired and exhausted from last night''s academic cramming as well as from the day that passed, I stepped off the bus and was readily greeted by Orion. Arr hunter, I say. Thanks for the greeting as I am here not to choose the events that will happen but to let the adventure choose me. Be my guide.\n\nFor the good part of the night we tried to make the provided tents as cozy as possible. Evidently, a man''s idea of "cozy" is way different from a woman''s. A tent is capable of holding six people but seven of us had to share, plus a few battalion of ants. I brought some mosquito repellent but I''m totally unprepared for these warriors, biting us violently for entering the critical zone of their territory. And we had our luggage with us too, taking up a generous part of our already-cramped tent. I remember being told once that pretty men travel light. If that is true, then Maria Makiling won''t be dating any of us by default.\n\nWe were briefed of what awaits us. I didn''t hear anything save for the word "exciting". After about an hour of planning we embark for slumber land and I felt the rough contours of the earth against my back.

This is the first time we''ll be actually cooking and, incidentally, my stomach''s been lucky enough to have a choice between two culinary sets so that if something goes wrong here, I always have the other group for back-up.

(31, 1, '2012-12-22 08:51:34', '2012-12-22 08:51:34', 'I spent last weekend in the wild, being dirty and sleeping inside cramped messy tents whose temperature fluctuates between cold and scorching hot, depending on what time of the day it is. I brought some mosquito repellent with me, only to find out that I should''ve feared the ants as well. The only way I could''ve cleaned myself (even partially) entailed going through the cold caress of mountain water. This is adventure indeed, the kind catterpillars sadly forget as they become butterflies.\r\n\r\nMy muscles are aching as I type like I worked out for a whole month straight without even a few seconds of water break anywhere in between. But the ache reminds me of a good two nights and two days spent in the cradle of Maria Makiling. Clearly, this is the welcome kind of muscle ache, one that is the sign not of deteriorating health but of a life lived in two-days'' worth of adventure. I''m both glad and sad that they''d be gone in a few days. How I''d miss this feeling and the kind of joy the experience brought me. I feel that I''ve lived life, for two nights and two days, as the experience took my breath away.\r\n\r\nBefore I delve into the fun of reliving the adventure allow me first to wish my left shoe a very solemn "Rest In Peace". You have been loyal to me for the past two years or so my dear friend, going through mud and shine, opening your mouth that protects the fingertips of my left foot eventually but not making a single sound of complaint. Your twin, right shoe, will have to rest as well, now that you are gone. I regret that he won''t be able to do it in the house though, as we are pretty crowded already.\r\n\r\nMy left shoe died an honorable death, in the midst of adventure, as I spent the good part of last weekend jumping through rocks and grabbing various plants for dear life, double checking in a hurried fashion beforehand that it is without thorns and that it is not actually some camouflaging fauna. It died last Saturday but I had to abuse it further by using it again for the same purposes the next day after last Saturday which is last Sunday. My vocal chords nearly died as well, as I screamed cheers and whoa''s in flow with my group''s collective effervescence.\r\n\r\nAnd as I know that general allusions to the experience will do the adventure no justice, allow me to compress about two days'' worth of story in a single web page, as I try to set the record for the longest blog post ever. Right. Let the stories start.\r\n\r\n<b>Table of Contents</b>\r\n<a href="http://skytreader.net/journal/meeting-maria#day1">Laying Down Ground</a> | <a href="http://skytreader.net/journal/meeting-maria#day2">The Trek</a> | <a href="http://skytreader.net/journal/meeting-maria#day3">Running Again, Some Swimming, and Goodbye Finally</a>\r\n\r\n<a id="day1" name="day1"></a>\r\n\r\nLaying Down Ground\r\nFriday, February 5, 2010, Deep Evening\r\n\r\nTired and exhausted from last night''s academic cramming as well as from the day that passed, I stepped off the bus and was readily greeted by Orion. Arr hunter, I say. Thanks for the greeting as I am here not to choose the events that will happen but to let the adventure choose me. Be my guide.\r\n\r\nFor the good part of the night we tried to make the provided tents as cozy as possible. Evidently, a man''s idea of "cozy" is way different from a woman''s. A tent is capable of holding six people but seven of us had to share, plus a few battalion of ants. I brought some mosquito repellent but I''m totally unprepared for these warriors, biting us violently for entering the critical zone of their territory. And we had our luggage with us too, taking up a generous part of our already-cramped tent. I remember being told once that pretty men travel light. If that is true, then Maria Makiling won''t be dating any of us by default.\r\n\r\nWe were briefed of what awaits us. I didn''t hear anything save for the word "exciting". After about an hour of planning we embark for slumber land and I felt the rough contours of the earth against my back. Adventure here we go!\r\n\r\n<a id="day2" name="day2"></a>\r\n\r\nThe Trek\r\nSaturday, February 6, 2010, Morning to Mid-Afternoon, and then whole day\r\n\r\nWe rose before the sun to prepare for what lies in store for the day. This is the first time we''ll be actually cooking and, incidentally, my stomach''s been lucky enough to have a choice between two culinary sets so that if something goes wrong here, I always have the other group for back-up. It''s a long and complicated story of how come there were two groups but in any case, the two groups merged into one later on, forming what can be considered as our main class, plus a few additions.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, pictures...\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Rappel Instructors" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4343350242/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Rappel Instructors" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4040/4343350242_589eba91f6_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>As you see, it was still pretty dark when we started cooking that I cannot rely on natural lighting and I had to resort to flash.

All of them major in Chemical Engineering. All of them are in the group with me even in the strictest sense. And all of them are fun to be with.</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI''m pretty fond of these people. For one, AJ has been my highschool classmate from year two to year four. Then again, they''re just plain fun to be with. And also, they are the second cooking group I''ve been talking about.\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4343360322/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2700/4343360322_908a3f103b_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\r\nAnd oh, yes, just to give you an idea, this is where we''ve been sleeping:\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Tents" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4342615167/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Tents" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4051/4342615167_ce310506bf_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\r\nBeing the celestial body lover that I am, I made sure that I know what time will the sun rise and set for the whole time we''ve been there, as part of my preparations. Unfortunately, sunrise and sunset isn''t as pronounced as I expected here. But that is not to say that I did not shoot some scenery.\r\n\r\nSaturday morning sunrise at camp...\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4343353158/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2702/4343353158_c0c5e6e92d_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4343354262/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4010/4343354262_090941d8bf_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4342620127/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2775/4342620127_a5f9aff911_b.jpg" width="461" height="614" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4342621399/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2727/4342621399_621c235d1f_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4342622855/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2688/4342622855_0b21ced4f6_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\r\nSaturday was scheduled for trek, an activity which I thought will have me clicking through shots and feeling the cool mountain breeze. I was wrong. The trek found me with my shirt glued wet by perspiration on my back. I found myself finally appreciating Gatorade and thanking AJ for lending me a cap. The trail was beautiful, green and overflowing with flora, ripe for some shots. Unfortunately, my hands had been busy looking for firm features to hold on to and breaking the momentum I gain as my feet followed the dictates of the natural laws of inclined planes, too tired to resist. This is where my left shoe died, in service, ever loyal.\r\n\r\nThat all said, I still managed to take some pictures while trekking.\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Dyan and Che, with a flower they find pretty" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4346422384/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Dyan and Che, with a flower they find pretty" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4014/4346422384_f989f424ce_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>Dyan and Che, with a flower they find pretty</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Don''t faeries bathe in here?" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4346424596/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Don''t faeries bathe in here?" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2613/4346424596_e70800d5b4_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>Don''t faeries bathe in here?</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4345683253/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4012/4345683253_cf3dd128e1_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>Taken just before we stopped to eat packed lunch live at the trail.</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4346429276/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2767/4346429276_02f68a8958_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>Ging and Baki.

Taken by Dyan.</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nReturning to camp, I found myself slumped dead near the entrance of our tent, not minding the heat, nor the flies buzzing around, nor the ants who seem addicted to my shirtless torso. I know not how many miles we walked nor how high a height we reached. I did not take a bath immediately which was lucky because our group had someone to sprawl on the ground when we were taught how to rescue someone down in a cliff with a possible spine injury.\r\n\r\nDarkness bit the skies again and soon we were cooking and eating by flashlight. It''s such a shame we were not able to light a bonfire because all the firewood around can only be found along the trail, and our own legs might just kick ourselves in protest if ever we plan to return there just to gather some firewood.\r\n\r\n<a id="day3" name="day3"></a>\r\n\r\nRunning Again, Some Swimming, and Goodbye Finally\r\nSunday, February 7, 2010, Morning to Mid-Afternoon\r\n\r\nAJ and me woke up at around 4AM. Being one of the two group leaders, AJ spent sometime going around the tents of our group, retrieving their consciousness from slumber. A few minutes into the activity and we were entertained by someone''s semi-consciousness and made-up terms courtesy of the spirit that is alcohol: <i>"Lutuin na yang mga AJ na yan!"</i> (Cook those AJ''s now!), and, <i>"Lagyan ng isang metrong wetness yung shroup"</i> (Add a meter of wetness to the shroup), she''s been saying (yes she''s a she). We laughed our heads off from that episode for about a couple of hours, until the person concerned regained full control of her consciousness and...you should''ve seen her face.\r\n\r\nI spent two hours doing nothing but walking around and eating breakfast, breathing fresh mountain air. It feels and sounds so bummer to relate that I ate instant noodles on a moment as fresh as that. Instant noodles is the only junk food that remains in my system after all. I''ve kicked my addiction to soft drinks and cheesy potato chips but not to instant noodles. Note, however, that I suggested, before Saturday''s adventure, that we hunt for snakes along the trail so that we''ll have something to cook in camp--a suggestion that was met with yeah-right faces from my groupmates.\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Breakfast at Camp" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4347544313/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Breakfast at Camp" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2777/4347544313_ee9d376f13_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>Sunday morning breakfast at camp.</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSunday''s most anticipated activity is map navigation, an activity very similar to trekking sans the almost-vertical slopes, packed lunch, and instructor guides but with a lot of competition, a lot of tasks and a single compass. I cannot decide what is more memorable between the trek and map nav. They''ll most probably tie. The trek is memorable because of the ooh''s and wow''s generated by nature''s beauty; map nav, on the other hand, is memorable due to all the adrenaline and willpower involved. We were so competitive in map nav that I really wasn''t able to take any pictures.\r\n\r\nWe were misguided and so we were lost for about a good half an hour. Nonetheless, we returned first in camp and you can only imagine with what euphoria did we tread around the still-empty tents, willpower being replaced by effervescence and cheers.

It was the feel-good upbeat of his <em>Wordplay</em> that caught my ears and it was the crazy wordplay of his <em>Geek in the Pink</em> which gave me the impetus to buy his album <em>Mr. A-Z</em> (which spells M-R-A-Z, in case you missed it). It was his blogging that made me decide to blog as well, and my attempts to find beauty and something good out of everyday is largely due to him (not to Hofstadter, as people might judge).\r\n\r\nAround two years ago, he released his third studio album <em>We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things</em>. Two years ago was the time I entered UP and his were the songs I sang as freshman life went by. I still recall singing the energy out of <em>Make It Mine</em> after grueling sessions from the best CS11 class ever. <em>Details in the Fabric</em> calmed my nerves after my skirmish that is Math17.\r\n\r\nIt was a good album all in all; I ripped 8 out of the 12 songs included into my playlist. After all, it had <em>I''m Yours</em>, which took <a href="http://craptaker.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Rona</a>, and also <em>Love for a Child</em> which is a very nice song from the onset to the moment you finally listen to the lyrics. It also had the bestest <em>torpe</em> song I''ve heard so far in the form of <em>If It Kills Me</em>. And most of all, it had <em>A Beautiful Mess</em>.\r\n\r\n<em>A Beautiful Mess</em> is a very nice song to sing right but very disastrous to get wrong (largely because its large fanbase will make you pay for your murder). It has a certain kind of poetry to it, one that makes you pause and feel the moment the notes and words register into your gray matter. I remember describing it to my sister as soundtrack-esque, meaning, I find it a song very fitting to play as the closing credits of a cathartic movie rolls. But I''ve said too much; I might be boring you.\r\n\r\nI''ve been a fan of <em>A Beautiful Mess</em> for two years now and it is only recently that I''ve made sense of its message. I''ve always thought it was about how life isn''t perfect but because you are here it is the best of all possible worlds. I now find that interpretation a little off mark.\r\n\r\nIt is about relationships.\r\n\r\nIt is about being you and I and we all at the same time. No matter how messy things may get, it is still beautiful by the mere fact that here we are, related by things so simple you''d find it stupid they can connect people at all; things like smiles and greetings and back-slaps and high fives and kisses. We. Indeed, tides may turn and hearts disfigure but that''s of no concern when we are wounded together. Now I know why that line moves me so.\r\n\r\nI am reminded that beauty is something you choose to see and create much like how love is something you choose to be. It seems to me that life is made up of choices, even in the most mundane of things. We are related because we chose to be in this together not because the gods wanted us to be. Things have always been up to us.\r\n\r\nWherever you may find yourself this coming rainy season, I hope you''d find yourself able to believe that the sun still waits behind the clouds. Or, if you aren''t really feeling very sympathetic towards the sun especially after his summer wave, why not put your umbrella down and dance in the rain? Across rocks and imaginary boundaries I''ll be dancing with you.\r\n\r\nAnd do yourself a favor and be Mrazmerized by a performance of <em>A Beautiful Mess</em>. Here are my favorites:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKtv4GR8M-8">A Beautiful Mess @ Royal Albert Hall</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch#!v=AKanbidzvUQ&amp;feature=related">A Beautiful Mess @ Nobel Peace Prize Concert</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MXLCB-4ncs&amp;NR=1">Rip-off from the Live DVD <em>Jason Mraz''s Beautiful Mess - Live on Earth</em></a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe rip-off from <em>Live on Earth</em> has the best quality among the three and the one from Royal Albert Hall has the lowest (it is but a bootleg). Nonetheless, I enjoyed the one from Royal Albert Hall the most. That performance has this tendency to make me feel empty and filled at the same time. <a href="http://freshnessfactorfivethousand.blogspot.com/2008/09/morning-after_27.html">It even moved Jason Mraz to tears</a>. The one from Nobel has him singing alongside a full orchestra, which in my opinion, magnifies the catharsis inspired by the song. Much like in relationships, beauty, and love, the choice is yours. Watch none, watch one, watch all or search YouTube for your own favorite. Again, the choice is yours.\r\n\r\nNamaste,\r\nYour Skymeister\r\n\r\nP.S.

Now I know why that line moves me so.\n\nI am reminded that beauty is something you choose to see and create much like how love is something you choose to be.

It was the feel-good upbeat of his <em>Wordplay</em> that caught my ears and it was the crazy wordplay of his <em>Geek in the Pink</em> which gave me the impetus to buy his album <em>Mr. A-Z</em> (which spells M-R-A-Z, in case you missed it). It was his blogging that made me decide to blog as well, and my attempts to find beauty and something good out of everyday is largely due to him (not to Hofstadter, as people might judge).\n\nAround two years ago, he released his third studio album <em>We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things</em>. Two years ago was the time I entered UP and his were the songs I sang as freshman life went by. I still recall singing the energy out of <em>Make It Mine</em> after grueling sessions from the best CS11 class ever. <em>Details in the Fabric</em> calmed my nerves after my skirmish that is Math17.\n\nIt was a good album all in all; I ripped 8 out of the 12 songs included into my playlist.

I saw a lot of people whom I haven''t seen for quite sometime now. It''s nice to meet people, especially if by chance. They catch you off guard with a greeting or a smile and the next thing you know you''d be having conversations again and laughing. Then, their lantern moves, the parade goes on...\r\n\r\nNot that it''s not nice to meet people in a planned manner. Much like adrenaline, they keep you standing. Later on, you sit in front of your computer and blog about the whole running-to-and-fro-to-get-pictures business and realize that it was such a tiring experience if not for the people-adrenaline that kept you up. People will never cease to amaze you, indeed. Surround yourself with them, in their own terms.\r\n\r\nDigicams are also nice and amazing. In an age of instant things, this is one of the few that really piqued my interest. Fortunately, unlike last year, I did not forget to bring my camera along with me. And so words relinquish control on to pictures.

Everyday I''d resolve to do something not so <i>circly</i>, to no avail. I think it''s hardcoded in my genes, drawing circles. My whole childhood art (self-)education ran in circles, with me drawing oblongs.\r\n\r\nEventually, I''d exchange pencils, colors and papers for computers and digicams.

(49, 1, '2010-12-19 08:29:01', '2010-12-19 08:29:01', 'So, Lantern Parade again. It wasn''t as funtastic as expected, I''m afraid, nor does it stand in comparison with my previous two. It rained before the parade started. Maybe there''s something with the water that broke down part of the spirit.\r\n\r\nThe Parade went as usual for the early part, with people crowding over this lantern and that. But as it wore the lantern lines broke in segments and it wasn''t very exciting anymore. And there was too much ideology involved. Not that you can wash that entirely away from something so UP. But, again, too much compared to my previous two.\r\n\r\nBut then I over speak. A post about the Lantern Parade is a post of pictures, of course. So here they are.\r\n\r\n<a title="An Early Drizzle" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5271652738/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="An Early Drizzle" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5086/5271652738_9738799c67.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>An early drizzle, which soaked the grounds as well as the AS steps, the effect being that those who opted to watch at the AS steps spent the night standing (or so my sister tells me). Which makes me wonder why...</div>\r\n<a title="Why are they sitting down?" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5270509770/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Why are they sitting down?" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5245/5270509770_7d036868de.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>...are they sitting down, here at the Engineering steps? Sure some of them had monoblocks and other what-have-you''s for dry sitting-down but most of them had none. And they sat down, monoblock or no monoblock.</div>\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5269898743/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5128/5269898743_c0bc4bc634.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\nAnyway, this was CSSP''s lantern/float before it rained.

I always hard-boiled Squirtle/Wartortle/Blastoise in his shell. Even if he beats me, I''d turn the GameBoy off without saving so that my loss is technically non-existent.

I made it a point to bring my umbrella, for Getsurikai''s sake. Thank heavens I had no need for it.\r\n\r\nI arrived at UP late by my standards. For the past three years, I''d usually arrive before lunch then hang out for some hours, reading a book I brought, until my friends start texting me, asking where in UP am I. I''d do that to avoid being hassled by the traffic caused by the Parade. For some reason the traffic-hassle didn''t give me enough incentive to get-up early this year. I was late but it was a nice start to the adventure as I got an opportunity to get a before-the-show feel for the event.\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Camera-Shy Horse" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6524622605/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Camera-Shy Horse" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7020/6524622605_7935d99774.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>This horse is too camera-shy.

And it was starting to get dark. Perfect for pictures like these...\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Melchor Hall, in Lights" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526233267/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Melchor Hall, in Lights" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7141/6526233267_1e8477b2a9.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\r\n<a title="Lighted Street" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526256373/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Lighted Street" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7151/6526256373_e05b77735f.jpg" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a title="Night Settling" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526278629/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Night Settling" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7028/6526278629_b3ced09f39.jpg" /></a>\r\n\r\nAt this point, I learned/realized a few things in photography.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>You really can''t do much if a scene''s lighting is poor to begin with. Not unless you have your own lighting equipment. But (a) I don''t have that and (b) that looks too out-of-place, space-taking, and inconsiderate for an event like the Lantern Parade.</li>\r\n	<li>Unlike a point-and-shoot''s flash, which fires the lights straight at your subject, an SLR fires flash upwards, assuming there is a ceiling to bounce the light downwards, diffused. This results to a better effect/less glare. There obviously isn''t a ceiling equivalent in <i>outdoors</i>, Lanter Parade set-up. I had to use my hands to direct the flash to my subjects (hood it over the flash like a "ceiling" which will quickly catch the lights and bounce it towards your subject). Thank goodness I realized this quickly.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo, as it was getting dark at this point, it became harder to get decent shots. Lighting was no longer on my side as I was already relying on flash. Otherwise, it''d be too dark or too orange depending on where I decide to shoot.\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Wall-E" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526288615/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Wall-E" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7169/6526288615_149dd71673.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\r\n<a title="The DCS contingent" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526300709/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="The DCS contingent" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7142/6526300709_5753471da0.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>Above pictured is Eng''g''s Wall-E, one of our lanterns, and the DCS/Cursor contingent of the Parade. Like last year, Eng''g scored with a particularly awesomazing lantern followed by a—wait for it—<i><b>boring</b></i> march of Eng''g orgs and banners. My sister, who majors in Broadcast Communication, likens it to <i>dead air</i> i.e., awkward and should-be-avoided pauses in radio productions. Unlike the last three years though, they, at least, weren''t wearing orange. Plus points for the fashion factor!</div>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Belly Dancers 1" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526312523/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Belly Dancers 1" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7165/6526312523_3940c75595.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\r\n<a title="Belly Dancers 2" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526328455/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Belly Dancers 2" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7002/6526328455_0f3c95ee95.jpg" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a title="The Fire" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526335201/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="The Fire" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7016/6526335201_9315e7c980.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>I took this shot from one of the torches of the Beta Sigma frat men. Their first number was the human chain/snake which I believe is part of their initiation rights. Even if it is my second time seeing this, it was still kind of chilling especially with their chant. I heard someone (was he from βσ?) call their second part <i>kata</i> which is the Karate equivalent of Taekwondo''s <i>poomsae</i> or forms. While their formation and synchronicity might look watch-worthy, it didn''t really catch my attention (maybe ''cause I''ve seen better during my TKD days). So, my eyes were wandering off to better photo-ops, their torch flames in particular. It, however, amuses me that Beta Sigma has their own blend of martial arts.</div>\r\nA few more lanterns and it was finally the turn of my most anticipated college ever.

And it was starting to get dark. Perfect for pictures like these...\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Melchor Hall, in Lights" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526233267/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Melchor Hall, in Lights" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7141/6526233267_1e8477b2a9.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a>\n\n<a title="Lighted Street" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526256373/" target="_blank"><img alt="Lighted Street" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7151/6526256373_e05b77735f.jpg" /></a>\n\n<a title="Night Settling" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526278629/" target="_blank"><img alt="Night Settling" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7028/6526278629_b3ced09f39.jpg" /></a></p>\nAt this point, I learned/realized a few things in photography.\n<ul>\n	<li>You really can''t do much if a scene''s lighting is poor to begin with. Not unless you have your own lighting equipment. But (a) I don''t have that and (b) that looks too out-of-place, space-taking, and inconsiderate for an event like the Lantern Parade.</li>\n	<li>Unlike a point-and-shoot''s flash, which fires the lights straight at your subject, an SLR fires flash upwards, assuming there is a ceiling to bounce the light downwards, diffused. This results to a better effect/less glare. There obviously isn''t a ceiling equivalent in <i>outdoors</i>, Lanter Parade set-up. I had to use my hands to direct the flash to my subjects (hood it over the flash like a "ceiling" which will quickly catch the lights and bounce it towards your subject). Thank goodness I realized this quickly.</li>\n</ul>\nSo, as it was getting dark at this point, it became harder to get decent shots. Lighting was no longer on my side as I was already relying on flash. Otherwise, it''d be too dark or too orange depending on where I decide to shoot.\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Wall-E" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526288615/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Wall-E" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7169/6526288615_149dd71673.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a>\n\n<a title="The DCS contingent" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526300709/" target="_blank"><img alt="The DCS contingent" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7142/6526300709_5753471da0.jpg" /></a></p>\n\n<div>Above pictured is Eng''g''s Wall-E, one of our lanterns, and the DCS/Cursor contingent of the Parade. Like last year, Eng''g scored with a particularly awesomazing lantern followed by a—wait for it—<i><b>boring</b></i> march of Eng''g orgs and banners. My sister, who majors in Broadcast Communication, likens it to <i>dead air</i> i.e., awkward and should-be-avoided pauses in radio productions. Unlike the last three years though, they, at least, weren''t wearing orange. Plus points for the fashion factor!</div>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Belly Dancers 1" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526312523/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Belly Dancers 1" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7165/6526312523_3940c75595.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a>\n\n<a title="Belly Dancers 2" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526328455/" target="_blank"><img alt="Belly Dancers 2" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7002/6526328455_0f3c95ee95.jpg" /></a>\n\n<a title="The Fire" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526335201/" target="_blank"><img alt="The Fire" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7016/6526335201_9315e7c980.jpg" /></a></p>\n\n<div>I took this shot from one of the torches of the Beta Sigma frat men. Their first number was the human chain/snake which I believe is part of their initiation rights. Even if it is my second time seeing this, it was still kind of chilling especially with their chant. I heard someone (was he from βσ?) call their second part <i>kata</i> which is the Karate equivalent of Taekwondo''s <i>poomsae</i> or forms. While their formation and synchronicity might look watch-worthy, it didn''t really catch my attention (maybe ''cause I''ve seen better during my TKD days). So, my eyes were wandering off to better photo-ops, their torch flames in particular.

I even exceeded my 300MB monthly upload limit at Flickr that I had to hijack on a new account to fit all these shots in!\n\nThat''s all for now. Hope you have a Merry Christmas! ~Chad\n\n*This imagery was inspired by an episode of Pokemon, Bulbasaur-Charmander-Squirtle(-Pikachu!) era. Brock was making rice cakes when Ash noticed a camera lens (wanting to take a picture of Pikachu) appear from behind some bushes. He over-reacted, imagining it to fire a laser projectile of sorts, and ruined their little rice cake picnic.

For the past three years, I''d usually arrive before lunch then hang out for some hours, reading a book I brought, until my friends start texting me, asking where in UP am I.

Perfect for pictures like these...\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Melchor Hall, in Lights" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526233267/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Melchor Hall, in Lights" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7141/6526233267_1e8477b2a9.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a>\n\n<a title="Lighted Street" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526256373/" target="_blank"><img alt="Lighted Street" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7151/6526256373_e05b77735f.jpg" /></a>\n\n<a title="Night Settling" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526278629/" target="_blank"><img alt="Night Settling" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7028/6526278629_b3ced09f39.jpg" /></a></p>\nAt this point, I learned/realized a few things in photography.\n<ul>\n	<li>You really can''t do much if a scene''s lighting is poor to begin with. Not unless you have your own lighting equipment. But (a) I don''t have that and (b) that looks too out-of-place, space-taking, and inconsiderate for an event like the Lantern Parade.</li>\n	<li>Unlike a point-and-shoot''s flash, which fires the lights straight at your subject, an SLR fires flash upwards, assuming there is a ceiling to bounce the light downwards, diffused. This results to a better effect/less glare. There obviously isn''t a ceiling equivalent in <i>outdoors</i>, Lanter Parade set-up. I had to use my hands to direct the flash to my subjects (hood it over the flash like a "ceiling" which will quickly catch the lights and bounce it towards your subject). Thank goodness I realized this quickly.</li>\n</ul>\nSo, as it was getting dark at this point, it became harder to get decent shots. Lighting was no longer on my side as I was already relying on flash. Otherwise, it''d be too dark or too orange depending on where I decide to shoot.\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Wall-E" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526288615/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Wall-E" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7169/6526288615_149dd71673.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a>\n\n<a title="The DCS contingent" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526300709/" target="_blank"><img alt="The DCS contingent" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7142/6526300709_5753471da0.jpg" /></a></p>\n\n<div>Above pictured is Eng''g''s Wall-E, one of our lanterns, and the DCS/Cursor contingent of the Parade. Like last year, Eng''g scored with a particularly awesomazing lantern followed by a—wait for it—<i><b>boring</b></i> march of Eng''g orgs and banners. My sister, who majors in Broadcast Communication, likens it to <i>dead air</i> i.e., awkward and should-be-avoided pauses in radio productions. Unlike the last three years though, they, at least, weren''t wearing orange. Plus points for the fashion factor!</div>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Belly Dancers 1" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526312523/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Belly Dancers 1" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7165/6526312523_3940c75595.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a>\n\n<a title="Belly Dancers 2" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526328455/" target="_blank"><img alt="Belly Dancers 2" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7002/6526328455_0f3c95ee95.jpg" /></a>\n\n<a title="The Fire" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526335201/" target="_blank"><img alt="The Fire" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7016/6526335201_9315e7c980.jpg" /></a></p>\n\n<div>I took this shot from one of the torches of the Beta Sigma frat men. Their first number was the human chain/snake which I believe is part of their initiation rights. Even if it is my second time seeing this, it was still kind of chilling especially with their chant. I heard someone (was he from βσ?) call their second part <i>kata</i> which is the Karate equivalent of Taekwondo''s <i>poomsae</i> or forms. While their formation and synchronicity might look watch-worthy, it didn''t really catch my attention (maybe ''cause I''ve seen better during my TKD days). So, my eyes were wandering off to better photo-ops, their torch flames in particular. It, however, amuses me that Beta Sigma has their own blend of martial arts.</div>\nA few more lanterns and it was finally the turn of my most anticipated college ever.

And it was starting to get dark. Perfect for pictures like these...\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Melchor Hall, in Lights" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526233267/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Melchor Hall, in Lights" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7141/6526233267_1e8477b2a9.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a title="Lighted Street" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526256373/" target="_blank"><img alt="Lighted Street" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7151/6526256373_e05b77735f.jpg" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a title="Night Settling" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526278629/" target="_blank"><img alt="Night Settling" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7028/6526278629_b3ced09f39.jpg" /></a></p>\r\nAt this point, I learned/realized a few things in photography.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>You really can''t do much if a scene''s lighting is poor to begin with. Not unless you have your own lighting equipment. But (a) I don''t have that and (b) that looks too out-of-place, space-taking, and inconsiderate for an event like the Lantern Parade.</li>\r\n	<li>Unlike a point-and-shoot''s flash, which fires the lights straight at your subject, an SLR fires flash upwards, assuming there is a ceiling to bounce the light downwards, diffused. This results to a better effect/less glare. There obviously isn''t a ceiling equivalent in <i>outdoors</i>, Lanter Parade set-up. I had to use my hands to direct the flash to my subjects (hood it over the flash like a "ceiling" which will quickly catch the lights and bounce it towards your subject). Thank goodness I realized this quickly.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo, as it was getting dark at this point, it became harder to get decent shots. Lighting was no longer on my side as I was already relying on flash. Otherwise, it''d be too dark or too orange depending on where I decide to shoot.\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Wall-E" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526288615/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Wall-E" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7169/6526288615_149dd71673.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a title="The DCS contingent" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526300709/" target="_blank"><img alt="The DCS contingent" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7142/6526300709_5753471da0.jpg" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>Above pictured is Eng''g''s Wall-E, one of our lanterns, and the DCS/Cursor contingent of the Parade. Like last year, Eng''g scored with a particularly awesomazing lantern followed by a—wait for it—<i><b>boring</b></i> march of Eng''g orgs and banners. My sister, who majors in Broadcast Communication, likens it to <i>dead air</i> i.e., awkward and should-be-avoided pauses in radio productions. Unlike the last three years though, they, at least, weren''t wearing orange. Plus points for the fashion factor!</div>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Belly Dancers 1" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526312523/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Belly Dancers 1" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7165/6526312523_3940c75595.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a title="Belly Dancers 2" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526328455/" target="_blank"><img alt="Belly Dancers 2" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7002/6526328455_0f3c95ee95.jpg" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a title="The Fire" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526335201/" target="_blank"><img alt="The Fire" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7016/6526335201_9315e7c980.jpg" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>I took this shot from one of the torches of the Beta Sigma frat men. Their first number was the human chain/snake which I believe is part of their initiation rights. Even if it is my second time seeing this, it was still kind of chilling especially with their chant. I heard someone (was he from βσ?) call their second part <i>kata</i> which is the Karate equivalent of Taekwondo''s <i>poomsae</i> or forms. While their formation and synchronicity might look watch-worthy, it didn''t really catch my attention (maybe ''cause I''ve seen better during my TKD days). So, my eyes were wandering off to better photo-ops, their torch flames in particular. It, however, amuses me that Beta Sigma has their own blend of martial arts.</div>\r\nA few more lanterns and it was finally the turn of my most anticipated college ever.

Not unless you have your own lighting equipment. But (a) I don''t have that and (b) that looks too out-of-place, space-taking, and inconsiderate for an event like the Lantern Parade.</li>\r\n	<li>Unlike a point-and-shoot''s flash, which fires the lights straight at your subject, an SLR fires flash upwards, assuming there is a ceiling to bounce the light downwards, diffused. This results to a better effect/less glare. There obviously isn''t a ceiling equivalent in <i>outdoors</i>, Lanter Parade set-up. I had to use my hands to direct the flash to my subjects (hood it over the flash like a "ceiling" which will quickly catch the lights and bounce it towards your subject). Thank goodness I realized this quickly.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo, as it was getting dark at this point, it became harder to get decent shots. Lighting was no longer on my side as I was already relying on flash. Otherwise, it''d be too dark or too orange depending on where I decide to shoot.\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Wall-E" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526288615/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Wall-E" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7169/6526288615_149dd71673.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a title="The DCS contingent" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526300709/" target="_blank"><img alt="The DCS contingent" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7142/6526300709_5753471da0.jpg" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>Above pictured is Eng''g''s Wall-E, one of our lanterns, and the DCS/Cursor contingent of the Parade. Like last year, Eng''g scored with a particularly awesomazing lantern followed by a—wait for it—<i><b>boring</b></i> march of Eng''g orgs and banners. My sister, who majors in Broadcast Communication, likens it to <i>dead air</i> i.e., awkward and should-be-avoided pauses in radio productions. Unlike the last three years though, they, at least, weren''t wearing orange. Plus points for the fashion factor!</div>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Belly Dancers 1" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526312523/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Belly Dancers 1" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7165/6526312523_3940c75595.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a title="Belly Dancers 2" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526328455/" target="_blank"><img alt="Belly Dancers 2" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7002/6526328455_0f3c95ee95.jpg" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a title="The Fire" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526335201/" target="_blank"><img alt="The Fire" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7016/6526335201_9315e7c980.jpg" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>I took this shot from one of the torches of the Beta Sigma frat men. Their first number was the human chain/snake which I believe is part of their initiation rights. Even if it is my second time seeing this, it was still kind of chilling especially with their chant. I heard someone (was he from βσ?) call their second part <i>kata</i> which is the Karate equivalent of Taekwondo''s <i>poomsae</i> or forms. While their formation and synchronicity might look watch-worthy, it didn''t really catch my attention (maybe ''cause I''ve seen better during my TKD days). So, my eyes were wandering off to better photo-ops, their torch flames in particular. It, however, amuses me that Beta Sigma has their own blend of martial arts.</div>\r\nA few more lanterns and it was finally the turn of my most anticipated college ever.

For the past three years, I''d usually arrive before lunch then hang out for some hours, reading a book I brought, until my friends start texting me, asking where in UP am I. I''d do that to avoid being hassled by the traffic caused by the Parade. For some reason the traffic-hassle didn''t give me enough incentive to get-up early this year.

And it was starting to get dark. Perfect for pictures like these...\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Melchor Hall, in Lights" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526233267/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Melchor Hall, in Lights" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7141/6526233267_1e8477b2a9.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\n<a title="Lighted Street" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526256373/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Lighted Street" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7151/6526256373_e05b77735f.jpg" /></a>\n\n<a title="Night Settling" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526278629/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Night Settling" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7028/6526278629_b3ced09f39.jpg" /></a>\n\nAt this point, I learned/realized a few things in photography.\n<ul>\n	<li>You really can''t do much if a scene''s lighting is poor to begin with. Not unless you have your own lighting equipment. But (a) I don''t have that and (b) that looks too out-of-place, space-taking, and inconsiderate for an event like the Lantern Parade.</li>\n	<li>Unlike a point-and-shoot''s flash, which fires the lights straight at your subject, an SLR fires flash upwards, assuming there is a ceiling to bounce the light downwards, diffused. This results to a better effect/less glare. There obviously isn''t a ceiling equivalent in <i>outdoors</i>, Lanter Parade set-up. I had to use my hands to direct the flash to my subjects (hood it over the flash like a "ceiling" which will quickly catch the lights and bounce it towards your subject). Thank goodness I realized this quickly.</li>\n</ul>\nSo, as it was getting dark at this point, it became harder to get decent shots. Lighting was no longer on my side as I was already relying on flash. Otherwise, it''d be too dark or too orange depending on where I decide to shoot.\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Wall-E" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526288615/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Wall-E" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7169/6526288615_149dd71673.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\n<a title="The DCS contingent" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526300709/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="The DCS contingent" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7142/6526300709_5753471da0.jpg" /></a>\n<div>Above pictured is Eng''g''s Wall-E, one of our lanterns, and the DCS/Cursor contingent of the Parade. Like last year, Eng''g scored with a particularly awesomazing lantern followed by a—wait for it—<i><b>boring</b></i> march of Eng''g orgs and banners. My sister, who majors in Broadcast Communication, likens it to <i>dead air</i> i.e., awkward and should-be-avoided pauses in radio productions. Unlike the last three years though, they, at least, weren''t wearing orange. Plus points for the fashion factor!</div>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Belly Dancers 1" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526312523/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Belly Dancers 1" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7165/6526312523_3940c75595.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\n<a title="Belly Dancers 2" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526328455/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Belly Dancers 2" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7002/6526328455_0f3c95ee95.jpg" /></a>\n\n<a title="The Fire" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526335201/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="The Fire" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7016/6526335201_9315e7c980.jpg" /></a>\n<div>I took this shot from one of the torches of the Beta Sigma frat men. Their first number was the human chain/snake which I believe is part of their initiation rights. Even if it is my second time seeing this, it was still kind of chilling especially with their chant. I heard someone (was he from βσ?) call their second part <i>kata</i> which is the Karate equivalent of Taekwondo''s <i>poomsae</i> or forms. While their formation and synchronicity might look watch-worthy, it didn''t really catch my attention (maybe ''cause I''ve seen better during my TKD days). So, my eyes were wandering off to better photo-ops, their torch flames in particular. It, however, amuses me that Beta Sigma has their own blend of martial arts.</div>\nA few more lanterns and it was finally the turn of my most anticipated college ever.

I was late but it was a nice start to the adventure as I got an opportunity to get a before-the-show feel for the event.\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Camera-Shy Horse" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6524622605/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Camera-Shy Horse" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7020/6524622605_7935d99774.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\n\n<div>This horse is too camera-shy. Everytime I''d point my lens at him he''d turn his head the other way. Maybe he''s proffering me his best angle? Maybe he thinks my lens is some kind of a laser cannon*? This is the best of him I got: snout complete with matching <i>calesa</i>.</div>\nI was happily shooting around Oblation Plaza when I saw our ROTC squad advancing towards Palma Hall. I remembered that they will be one of the first parties to parade. So I hurriedly ended my little photoshoot, reasoning with myself that I need to conserve batteries as I don''t have any spare.\n\nBut not long after, the beauty of the Carillion took me in...\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Hiding" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6524634145/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Hiding" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7143/6524634145_720489ca93.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\n<a title="The UP Carillion" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6524641123/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="The UP Carillion" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7156/6524641123_db13811fdc.jpg" /></a>\n\nWe decided to station ourselves in front of Melchor Hall being that it is at the last leg of the Parade. Last leg == night time (eventually) == more awesome for the lovely lantern lights.\n\nThat said, with all my hurrying, we still had lots of idle time when our group was finally completed.

And it was starting to get dark. Perfect for pictures like these...\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Melchor Hall, in Lights" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526233267/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Melchor Hall, in Lights" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7141/6526233267_1e8477b2a9.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\n<a title="Lighted Street" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526256373/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Lighted Street" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7151/6526256373_e05b77735f.jpg" /></a>\n\n<a title="Night Settling" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526278629/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Night Settling" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7028/6526278629_b3ced09f39.jpg" /></a>\n\nAt this point, I learned/realized a few things in photography.\n<ul>\n	<li>You really can''t do much if a scene''s lighting is poor to begin with. Not unless you have your own lighting equipment. But (a) I don''t have that and (b) that looks too out-of-place, space-taking, and inconsiderate for an event like the Lantern Parade.</li>\n	<li>Unlike a point-and-shoot''s flash, which fires the lights straight at your subject, an SLR fires flash upwards, assuming there is a ceiling to bounce the light downwards, diffused. This results to a better effect/less glare. There obviously isn''t a ceiling equivalent in <i>outdoors</i>, Lanter Parade set-up. I had to use my hands to direct the flash to my subjects (hood it over the flash like a "ceiling" which will quickly catch the lights and bounce it towards your subject). Thank goodness I realized this quickly.</li>\n</ul>\nSo, as it was getting dark at this point, it became harder to get decent shots. Lighting was no longer on my side as I was already relying on flash. Otherwise, it''d be too dark or too orange depending on where I decide to shoot.\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Wall-E" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526288615/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Wall-E" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7169/6526288615_149dd71673.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\n<a title="The DCS contingent" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526300709/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="The DCS contingent" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7142/6526300709_5753471da0.jpg" /></a>\n<div>Above pictured is Eng''g''s Wall-E, one of our lanterns, and the DCS/Cursor contingent of the Parade. Like last year, Eng''g scored with a particularly awesomazing lantern followed by a—wait for it—<i><b>boring</b></i> march of Eng''g orgs and banners. My sister, who majors in Broadcast Communication, likens it to <i>dead air</i> i.e., awkward and should-be-avoided pauses in radio productions. Unlike the last three years though, they, at least, weren''t wearing orange. Plus points for the fashion factor!</div>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Belly Dancers 1" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526312523/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Belly Dancers 1" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7165/6526312523_3940c75595.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\n<a title="Belly Dancers 2" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526328455/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Belly Dancers 2" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7002/6526328455_0f3c95ee95.jpg" /></a>\n\n<a title="The Fire" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526335201/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="The Fire" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7016/6526335201_9315e7c980.jpg" /></a>\n<div>I took this shot from one of the torches of the Beta Sigma frat men. Their first number was the human chain/snake which I believe is part of their initiation rights. Even if it is my second time seeing this, it was still kind of chilling especially with their chant. I heard someone (was he from βσ?) call their second part <i>kata</i> which is the Karate equivalent of Taekwondo''s <i>poomsae</i> or forms. While their formation and synchronicity might look watch-worthy, it didn''t really catch my attention (maybe ''cause I''ve seen better during my TKD days). So, my eyes were wandering off to better photo-ops, their torch flames in particular. It, however, amuses me that Beta Sigma has their own blend of martial arts.</div>\nA few more lanterns and it was finally the turn of my most anticipated college ever.

A Sony <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-lens_translucent_camera" target="_blank">SLT</a>-A35 whom I have decided to christen "Getsurikai".

I''ll miss your compact feel, how I can carry you everyday, except when my bag is too crowded already.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\nI''m not really a fan of anime but I''m quite a huge fan of BLEACH!. Those who know their BLEACH! will know from where did I pattern the name "Getsurikai". It isn''t very clean Japanese from what I''ve been told but hey, I like the sound of it so I''m taking artistic license. And oh, it literally means "moon grasp" by the way.\r\n\r\nThese past few days, I''ve been busy trying to get the feel for it. So far, the biggest adjustment I had to make is the placement of controls. Whereas my old Kodak has all controls at the right-hand side, Getsurikai has it both in the left and right-hand side. Kodak has its shooting mode settings on a dial around the shutter button but that is where Getsurikai has its on/off switch, the shooting modes being in a dial at the left of the viewfinder.

I made it a point to bring my umbrella, for Getsurikai''s sake. Thank heavens I had no need for it.\r\n\r\nI arrived at UP late by my standards. For the past three years, I''d usually arrive before lunch then hang out for some hours, reading a book I brought, until my friends start texting me, asking where in UP am I. I''d do that to avoid being hassled by the traffic caused by the Parade. For some reason the traffic-hassle didn''t give me enough incentive to get-up early this year. I was late but it was a nice start to the adventure as I got an opportunity to get a before-the-show feel for the event.\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Camera-Shy Horse" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6524622605/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Camera-Shy Horse" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7020/6524622605_7935d99774.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>This horse is too camera-shy.

And it was starting to get dark. Perfect for pictures like these...\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Melchor Hall, in Lights" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526233267/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Melchor Hall, in Lights" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7141/6526233267_1e8477b2a9.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\r\n<a title="Lighted Street" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526256373/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Lighted Street" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7151/6526256373_e05b77735f.jpg" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a title="Night Settling" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526278629/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Night Settling" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7028/6526278629_b3ced09f39.jpg" /></a>\r\n\r\nAt this point, I learned/realized a few things in photography.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>You really can''t do much if a scene''s lighting is poor to begin with. Not unless you have your own lighting equipment. But (a) I don''t have that and (b) that looks too out-of-place, space-taking, and inconsiderate for an event like the Lantern Parade.</li>\r\n	<li>Unlike a point-and-shoot''s flash, which fires the lights straight at your subject, an SLR fires flash upwards, assuming there is a ceiling to bounce the light downwards, diffused. This results to a better effect/less glare. There obviously isn''t a ceiling equivalent in <i>outdoors</i>, Lanter Parade set-up. I had to use my hands to direct the flash to my subjects (hood it over the flash like a "ceiling" which will quickly catch the lights and bounce it towards your subject). Thank goodness I realized this quickly.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo, as it was getting dark at this point, it became harder to get decent shots. Lighting was no longer on my side as I was already relying on flash. Otherwise, it''d be too dark or too orange depending on where I decide to shoot.\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Wall-E" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526288615/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Wall-E" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7169/6526288615_149dd71673.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\r\n<a title="The DCS contingent" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526300709/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="The DCS contingent" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7142/6526300709_5753471da0.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>Above pictured is Eng''g''s Wall-E, one of our lanterns, and the DCS/Cursor contingent of the Parade. Like last year, Eng''g scored with a particularly awesomazing lantern followed by a—wait for it—<i><b>boring</b></i> march of Eng''g orgs and banners. My sister, who majors in Broadcast Communication, likens it to <i>dead air</i> i.e., awkward and should-be-avoided pauses in radio productions. Unlike the last three years though, they, at least, weren''t wearing orange. Plus points for the fashion factor!</div>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Belly Dancers 1" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526312523/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Belly Dancers 1" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7165/6526312523_3940c75595.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\r\n<a title="Belly Dancers 2" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526328455/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Belly Dancers 2" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7002/6526328455_0f3c95ee95.jpg" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a title="The Fire" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526335201/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="The Fire" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7016/6526335201_9315e7c980.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>I took this shot from one of the torches of the Beta Sigma frat men. Their first number was the human chain/snake which I believe is part of their initiation rights. Even if it is my second time seeing this, it was still kind of chilling especially with their chant. I heard someone (was he from βσ?) call their second part <i>kata</i> which is the Karate equivalent of Taekwondo''s <i>poomsae</i> or forms. While their formation and synchronicity might look watch-worthy, it didn''t really catch my attention (maybe ''cause I''ve seen better during my TKD days). So, my eyes were wandering off to better photo-ops, their torch flames in particular. It, however, amuses me that Beta Sigma has their own blend of martial arts.</div>\r\nA few more lanterns and it was finally the turn of my most anticipated college ever.

For the past three years, I''d usually arrive before lunch then hang out for some hours, reading a book I brought, until my friends start texting me, asking where in UP am I. I''d do that to avoid being hassled by the traffic caused by the Parade. For some reason the traffic-hassle didn''t give me enough incentive to get-up early this year.

And it was starting to get dark. Perfect for pictures like these...\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Melchor Hall, in Lights" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526233267/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Melchor Hall, in Lights" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7141/6526233267_1e8477b2a9.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\r\n<a title="Lighted Street" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526256373/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Lighted Street" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7151/6526256373_e05b77735f.jpg" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a title="Night Settling" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526278629/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Night Settling" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7028/6526278629_b3ced09f39.jpg" /></a>\r\n\r\nAt this point, I learned/realized a few things in photography.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>You really can''t do much if a scene''s lighting is poor to begin with. Not unless you have your own lighting equipment. But (a) I don''t have that and (b) that looks too out-of-place, space-taking, and inconsiderate for an event like the Lantern Parade.</li>\r\n	<li>Unlike a point-and-shoot''s flash, which fires the lights straight at your subject, an SLR fires flash upwards, assuming there is a ceiling to bounce the light downwards, diffused. This results to a better effect/less glare. There obviously isn''t a ceiling equivalent in <i>outdoors</i>, Lanter Parade set-up. I had to use my hands to direct the flash to my subjects (hood it over the flash like a "ceiling" which will quickly catch the lights and bounce it towards your subject). Thank goodness I realized this quickly.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo, as it was getting dark at this point, it became harder to get decent shots. Lighting was no longer on my side as I was already relying on flash. Otherwise, it''d be too dark or too orange depending on where I decide to shoot.\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Wall-E" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526288615/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Wall-E" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7169/6526288615_149dd71673.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\r\n<a title="The DCS contingent" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526300709/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="The DCS contingent" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7142/6526300709_5753471da0.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>Above pictured is Eng''g''s Wall-E, one of our lanterns, and the DCS/Cursor contingent of the Parade. Like last year, Eng''g scored with a particularly awesomazing lantern followed by a—wait for it—<i><b>boring</b></i> march of Eng''g orgs and banners. My sister, who majors in Broadcast Communication, likens it to <i>dead air</i> i.e., awkward and should-be-avoided pauses in radio productions. Unlike the last three years though, they, at least, weren''t wearing orange. Plus points for the fashion factor!</div>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Belly Dancers 1" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526312523/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Belly Dancers 1" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7165/6526312523_3940c75595.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\r\n<a title="Belly Dancers 2" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526328455/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Belly Dancers 2" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7002/6526328455_0f3c95ee95.jpg" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a title="The Fire" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526335201/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="The Fire" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7016/6526335201_9315e7c980.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>I took this shot from one of the torches of the Beta Sigma frat men. Their first number was the human chain/snake which I believe is part of their initiation rights. Even if it is my second time seeing this, it was still kind of chilling especially with their chant. I heard someone (was he from βσ?) call their second part <i>kata</i> which is the Karate equivalent of Taekwondo''s <i>poomsae</i> or forms. While their formation and synchronicity might look watch-worthy, it didn''t really catch my attention (maybe ''cause I''ve seen better during my TKD days). So, my eyes were wandering off to better photo-ops, their torch flames in particular. It, however, amuses me that Beta Sigma has their own blend of martial arts.</div>\r\nA few more lanterns and it was finally the turn of my most anticipated college ever.

Lucky me.

(L-R) Row I: Dream Country, Season of Mists, A Game of You. Row II: The Dream Hunters, Preludes and Nocturnes, The Sandman King of Dreams.[/caption]\r\n\r\n<i>Dream Hunters</i>, that golden book at the lower-left corner, is a spin-off volume penned by Neil Gaiman in celebration of a Sandman anniversary. This book, unlike the "canonical" ten-volume series, isn''t a comic book; it is a novel, richly clad with illustrations from Yoshitaka Amano, of Final Fantasy fame. The black one at the lower-right corner, differs with the rest of the books in this picture as it isn''t really a brainchild of Gaiman. It isn''t even a story. <i>The Sandman King of Dreams</i> is a book by Alisa Kwitney, third assistant editor of the <i>Sandman</i> series, which is more or less like a guide/behind the scenes to the ten-volume epic.\r\n\r\nAnd then there is the matter of a little-known story regarding my summer class adventure. I''ve talked about my first encounter with Physics hell but not about this one. Not that I haven''t talked about it at all; I tell the people I encounter about my fantastic discovery and, in the process, realize how too few people know how expensive books can get.\r\n\r\nIn UP, it isn''t surprising to encounter book stands at any time of the year, at any corner of the campus. Most of these book stands sell books you won''t find in bookstores: from books censored due to extreme (usually leftist) radicalism to books that bookstores don''t sell just because the book concerned is way past its sell-time prime, to books you won''t find in bookstores because they are already too old and dusty for colorful shelves. I am not much a fan of them but every once in a while I find a book I really like on their displays.\r\n\r\nThese book stands come and go, which is really inconvenient should you find a book you''ve been really looking for in their displays but will not have the money for it until next week. You return next week only to find an empty spot in the place where the book stand should''ve been. You despair for the missed chance and maybe curse off the delicious lunch which drained your pockets last week, before you encountered the book of your dreams.\r\n\r\nAnd then there is that book stand along AS Walk which I, for the sake of having something to refer to, will baptize as <i>Manong''s Mega Book Stand</i>.\r\n\r\nI encountered <i>Manong''s Mega Book Stand</i> just last summer. As I am not a very huge fan of book stands I came in just wanting to have good look around, just in case I get that rare <i>Eureka!</i> moment that I find a book there that I can''t find elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe moment I stepped in, I realized the difference between <i>Manong''s Mega Book Stand</i> and all the other book stands instantly for there, on the shelves of <i>Manong''s Mega Book Stand</i> stood a decent number of books I would really like to have on my personal library. And they are sold in prices way cheaper than their book store counterparts.\r\n\r\nFrom memory, <i>Manong''s Mega Book Stand</i> has the following books:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Books by Arturo Perez-Reverte, especially some of the books in his <i>Capitan Alatriste</i> series.</li>\r\n	<li>Books on Philosophy.</li>\r\n	<li>Books by Salman Rushdie.</li>\r\n	<li>Collections of <i>The Far Side</i> comics.</li>\r\n	<li>Graphic novels (I distinctly remember <i>Watchmen</i>)</li>\r\n	<li>Graphic novels by Neil Gaiman (that is to say, graphic novels of <i>Neverwhere</i>, <i>Stardust</i>, <i>Black Orchid</i>, possibly more that I just can''t remember. And yes, "Graphic novels by Neil Gaiman" also means the<b>complete</b> <i>Sandman</i> series).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI do not know if <i>Manong''s Mega Book Stand</i> still has the complete <i>Sandman</i> series. After all, <b><i>I already have, in my book shelves, a good majority of them</i></b>. Thanks to <i>Manong''s Mega Book Stand</i>, I have already completed my Sandman Library.\r\n\r\n[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="461"]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4082331133/"><img alt="" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3534/4082331133_7d36cb9a2a_b.jpg" width="461" height="614" /></a> My Sandman Library circa November 5, 2009.

(81, 1, '2012-12-29 12:48:38', '2012-12-29 12:48:38', 'I return to this journal page after my semi-introduction musing holding in my fingertips some November News. I should be facing the interface of OpenOffice Writer, adding words to my NaNoWriMo word count in a desperate attempt to reach 50,000 on or before November 30 midnight. But then some news just can''t wait to be <del>bragged</del> blogged about. The kind of news that 140 characters of Twitter won''t be able to <del>brag</del> blog. So here I am, in the full 150MB glory of my web space, <del>bragging</del> blogging about some November News. (Note to self: Remind me that I do not Twitter and that I haven''t any plans of doing so yet).\n\nAh word counts. After a week, it seems that my <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> for this year will be a good deal better than my NaNoWriMo last year--let''s hope I get over this awkward transition scene I am writing and that this NaNoWriMo goodness continues. I have a story inside my head and when a story is trapped inside your head, the bestest thing to do is to write it down till it shuts up, or else the idea might get jealous at your neglect and go to goodness-knows-where. I am grateful to this idea for not running away and reminding me of itself in my time of greatest need. After all, I''ve held it inside my head for almost a year now. This idea presented itself to me while I am in a math class. I don''t know why, of all places, did it appear to me in a math class. I guess that just goes to testify that boring lectures really do hound me left and right. (Note to self: I didn''t find Math53 boring at all. Of all my maths it is the one I enjoyed best so far).\n\nFor the first three days of November, I''ve written more than the daily target word count. But on the fourth day enrollment kicked in, opposing my momentum with such vehement force. Now, every second is an essential second as I try to get ahead of schedule once more. I''m not gunning to write the next bestseller. I just want to write. In any case I am sure that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_(series)">something</a> will always be worse than the product of my one-month writing frenzy. (Note to self: Remind me to cheat the NaNoWriMo word count validator AI and paste this blog entry alongside my novel. To rack up my word count of course!)\n\nAnd now we turn to <i>the</i> November News worth <del>bragging</del> blogging about...\n\nIt isn''t news that I am such a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_(Vertigo)">Sandman</a> fan. That little tribute I have (reinstated) in my homepage isn''t new; I once had it adorning the headers of a dream journal.\n\nNeedless to say, Sandman is too costly a leisure for my limited finances. And UP students aren''t really known for being rich. I entered UP with only three copies of Neil Gaiman''s acclaimed work.\n\n[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="614"]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4082325263/"><img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2496/4082325263_159ce0ee1f_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a> My Sandman Library, before I entered UP.

I''m also a huge fan of Neil Gaiman (and his epic, <i>The Sandman</i>). From Rowling and Gaiman, I picked up a whole slew of other authors to read like Lovecraft, Funke, and Lewis.\r\n\r\nThe literature course I took in college introduced me to a whole bunch of other authors. I did not appreciate everything in our reading list for that class but, among those I did, I ended up being fond of Italo Calvino and Arturo Perez-Reverte. Reading discussions about their work made me curious about other authors such as Umberto Eco and Aldous Huxley. Perez-Reverte made me check out other thrillers like Elizabeth Kostova''s <em>The Historian</em> and Graham Moore''s <em>The Sherlockian</em> ((If you managed to deduce that I''ve also read all the canonical Holmes stories, congrats!)).\r\n<h2>I''m a writer</h2>\r\n<h2>I''m a photodocumanitarian</h2>\r\n<h2>I''m a maker</h2>', 'Stuff I Do', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '13-revision-4', '', '', '2012-12-29 10:13:55', '2012-12-29 10:13:55', '', 13, 'http://localhost/skytreader.net/journal/13-revision-4', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

It rained before the parade started. Maybe there''s something with the water that broke down part of the spirit.\r\n\r\nThe Parade went as usual for the early part, with people crowding over this lantern and that. But as it wore the lantern lines broke in segments and it wasn''t very exciting anymore. And there was too much ideology involved. Not that you can wash that entirely away from something so UP. But, again, too much compared to my previous two.\r\n\r\nBut then I over speak. A post about the Lantern Parade is a post of pictures, of course.

I don''t know what''s up with CSSP this year but they seem to be in a particularly celebratory mood; they even had sportsfests and pageants (a la Miss Eng''g, in my opinion) this year. Whatever the celebration may be, cheers to them.\r\n\r\nSee those crayons? They melted thanks to the rain, so unlike real crayons which melts with fire, not water.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<a title="Pouncing Zebra" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5270538088/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Pouncing Zebra" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5168/5270538088_9ee1c0ec79.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div><b>Aside:</b> This zebra is so cute.

I think some of them was more driven by ideology than by art.\r\n\r\nEngineering---my college---was a big let down, I''m afraid. It started with a particularly crowd-whoa-drawing contraption which looked like a horse''s skeleton with a rider too small for it at the top. Then the rider pedals the bike and the contraption moves and the crowd is amazed. It was followed by electronic (read: Earth-friendly) jeepneys. And then a long march of Engineering organizations which didn''t display anything much aside from orange shirts courtesy of Meralco and org banners.\r\n\r\nUpon entering UP, our Dean then told us the story behind our College''s Lantern Parade performance. There was a time when no one gave much damn on our lantern. Then she gave the ultimatum that, if our Lantern Parade performance remains lackluster, Eng''g Week* won''t be held next year. And the rest is, as they say, history. I don''t know how true this story is, me being unaffliated, but I think it is time to amend that order to something that will require the orgs to show something worth watching. Just my two cents.\r\n\r\nAnyway, we jump to the show stealers of always, the ever-awesome College of Fine Arts.\r\n\r\nI can''t help but feel that their parade is shorter than usual this year. I didn''t see any of the people I know in Fine Arts. But still, they''re awesome.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5270521654/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5290/5270521654_4c809edb4f.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>It''s not much of a shot on my part but this style of lantern is something I find so nice.</div>\r\n<a title="King Blastoise Waving" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5269917513/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="King Blastoise Waving" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5242/5269917513_38b5bdb528.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>King Blastoise you''re so awesome and you''re waving at me!</div>\r\nI''ll tell you a secret and please make sure that King Blastoise here won''t know ''cause he''s so freaking awesome I wouldn''t want to anger him. Back in those days when I spent the day beeping on my high-tech Tamagochi that is Pokemon in the GameBoy Color, I''m not really a very huge Blastoise (or, for that matter, water-type) fan. I''m more the fire type kind of trainer. When Oak/Elm asks me to choose, I always chose Charmander/Cyndaquil which eventually evolves to Charizard/Typhloshion. And then my rival will choose the water-type, Squirtle/Totodile, which grows to Blastoise/Feraligatr. And you know what? I always beat my rival despite the type advantage. I always hard-boiled Squirtle/Wartortle/Blastoise in his shell. Even if he beats me, I''d turn the GameBoy off without saving so that my loss is technically non-existent. Then I''d turn it back on and train some more before having another go at cooking some hard-boiled pokemon.

I think she acquired them around mid-month. Of course, my first instinct was to jump in and take pictures. Yay.\r\n\r\nI know that roses—like books, butterflies, and hearts—are fragile things but I never knew that they are that delicate that it is quite a task keeping them alive. I don''t know much about gardening but my mom said something along the lines of, "I hope I can make them last".

Or is it the other way around, that those which are beautiful are fragile? Roses, books, butterflies, hearts—or why I''m so sure the world is beautiful.\r\n\r\nFor next month, I guess I''ll find something moving, throw in a person or two in the frame maybe. If you head over to my <a href="http://chadestioco.deviantart.com/" target="_blank">DeviantArt</a> you''ll see lot''s of flower pics in there. I find flowers that beautiful that I can''t stop myself from taking pictures when I see some interesting ones—which scares me a bit. I guess it''s every artist''s fear that he has ran out of new ideas to try, that his recurring themes are no more than reused cliche. Where do you draw the line between recurring themes and loss of fresh ideas?\r\n\r\nBut hey this post is supposed to be happy. In other news, I''m no longer doing my thesis/special problem alone. I''m with two ladies and we''re working on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porites" target="_blank">Porites</a> a genus of corals. More about the problem as we progress.

Despite calling you my "main" blog I am aware that you are probably jealous at how <a href="http://kodeplay.skytreader.net/" target="_blank">kode.play</a> hogged all my attention this past summer. It was unavoidable, being that I had to blog about my internship and that the posts created were inevitably technical in nature. But it''s over now.\r\n\r\nI''m not sure that the posts will be back to my normal one-post-per-month quota though. I''ll be doing my thesis/special problem this year. And have I told you that, through some turn events, I''ll be doing this solo flight? (<i>Anak ng...</i>special problem <i>nga</i>) This early on, I''m taking leave that I may miss more posts.\r\n\r\n(But wait! I got a back-up plan. In anticipation of some middle-term plan I''m hatching, I''ll be posting, instead of my usual tirade of words, a photograph of the month, taken by yours truly. That should be pretty easy for me to meet and squeeze in a schedule expected to be full eh?)\r\n\r\nI never really planned to do my thesis solo. Maybe I did but that was only at the start of my college career; when I saw how chaotic things can get I started considering doing it with a group, a consideration I held on to until I received the email welcoming me to the research lab I applied to. My name was there, at the top, alone in it''s line, unaccompanied by those whom I contacted as group mates—a solo flight ticket. "Chad," says Neil, a gifted artist I hang around with, "if you need a crying shoulder anytime this coming year, we''re here."\r\n\r\nIn my renewed sense of optimism and belief in reasons reason does not know, I can''t help but feel that doing my thesis alone is a challenge especially meant for me. Back in high school, I always dreamed of the time I get to make a system on my own, large enough to make a decent dent on a CD''s 700MB worth of storage space. I don''t know how large do theses get but I''m pretty sure I''ll be exceeding the line count of the spaghetti behind<a href="http://gradegrid.skytreader.net/" target="_blank">GradeGrid</a> or the 1087 lines of code behind the programming language I created for my Programming Laguages class. Well, here''s my shot at immortality, I say.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://skytreader.net/journal/announcing-an-adventure">Months back</a>, I said that my internship will probably be the longest three units of my life. Over at <a href="http://kodeplay.skytreader.net/2011/05/28/andreis-awesomely-amazing-android-adventure-at-azeus/" target="_blank">{kode.play();}</a>*, I have a record of how many hours did I spend for my internship. I clocked in around 281 hours and 52 minutes in around 7 weeks. I created a timer program that will keep track of how many hours do I spend working on something, inspired by an internal tool from Azeus. I''ll be timing how much time will I spend on my thesis. Anyone wants to bet as to which will be longer, internship or thesis?\r\n<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5823237029/" target="_blank"><img alt="Beauty Unnoticed" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3257/5823237029_66ac946d6c.jpg" width="500" /></a></div>\r\nStay beautiful, it''s a new beginning ~ The Chad Estioco\r\n\r\n*Yep, I changed the styling of kode.play, to make it more geeeky.

What a shame considering that the calendar month concerned was the month I turned 18, fully responsible at last for the adventures I''m having and not having. I blame school work for my lapse. I am sorry but it might happen again.\r\n\r\nDuring my birth week I was swamped. I spent my first day as an eighteener being sick and solving discrete probability equations. Not exactly my idea of being 18 at last, though the probability-solving bit can still be argued for. During the last few days of last month I was cramming boolean logic into my brain, so wanting to do nothing but code away. I can no longer remember what happened in the interim but it was most likely spent thinking that I am finally at that part of my adventure when school and education presents themselves most differently.

Despite calling you my "main" blog I am aware that you are probably jealous at how <a href="http://kodeplay.skytreader.net/" target="_blank">kode.play</a> hogged all my attention this past summer. It was unavoidable, being that I had to blog about my internship and that the posts created were inevitably technical in nature. But it''s over now.\n\nI''m not sure that the posts will be back to my normal one-post-per-month quota though. I''ll be doing my thesis/special problem this year. And have I told you that, through some turn events, I''ll be doing this solo flight? (<i>Anak ng...</i>special problem <i>nga</i>) This early on, I''m taking leave that I may miss more posts.\n\n(But wait! I got a back-up plan. In anticipation of some middle-term plan I''m hatching, I''ll be posting, instead of my usual tirade of words, a photograph of the month, taken by yours truly. That should be pretty easy for me to meet and squeeze in a schedule expected to be full eh?)\n\nI never really planned to do my thesis solo. Maybe I did but that was only at the start of my college career; when I saw how chaotic things can get I started considering doing it with a group, a consideration I held on to until I received the email welcoming me to the research lab I applied to. My name was there, at the top, alone in it''s line, unaccompanied by those whom I contacted as group mates—a solo flight ticket. "Chad," says Neil, a gifted artist I hang around with, "if you need a crying shoulder anytime this coming year, we''re here."\n\nIn my renewed sense of optimism and belief in reasons reason does not know, I can''t help but feel that doing my thesis alone is a challenge especially meant for me. Back in high school, I always dreamed of the time I get to make a system on my own, large enough to make a decent dent on a CD''s 700MB worth of storage space. I don''t know how large do theses get but I''m pretty sure I''ll be exceeding the line count of the spaghetti behind<a href="http://gradegrid.skytreader.net/" target="_blank">GradeGrid</a> or the 1087 lines of code behind the programming language I created for my Programming Laguages class. Well, here''s my shot at immortality, I say.\n\n<a href="http://skytreader.net/journal/announcing-an-adventure">Months back</a>, I said that my internship will probably be the longest three units of my life. Over at <a href="http://kodeplay.skytreader.net/2011/05/28/andreis-awesomely-amazing-android-adventure-at-azeus/" target="_blank">{kode.play();}</a>*, I have a record of how many hours did I spend for my internship. I clocked in around 281 hours and 52 minutes in around 7 weeks. I created a timer program that will keep track of how many hours do I spend working on something, inspired by an internal tool from Azeus. I''ll be timing how much time will I spend on my thesis. Anyone wants to bet as to which will be longer, internship or thesis?\n<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5823237029/" target="_blank"><img alt="Beauty Unnoticed" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3257/5823237029_66ac946d6c.jpg" width="500" /></a></div>\nStay beautiful, it''s a new beginning ~ The Chad Estioco\n\n*Yep, I changed the styling of kode.play, to make it more geeeky.

The moment you learn that you have received an invitation, you get so excited you''d want to jump straight in. And jump straight in you do, not minding the initial discouragement provided by long queues. Your body makes a cold splash into the surface and underneath you go. The water is cool. You smile in between segments of underwater respiration. You cherish the smooth feel the enveloping water gives. Wonderful.\r\n\r\nAnd when your lungful of air is over, you break through the film of the surface once more, this time around attacking it from below. You look back and you realize that you''re already quite far from the shore. Must''ve been quite a dive eh? Then someone taps you and points forward. You see sharks. You try to turn back but then this person who pointed the sharks points to a sign saying "No swimming backwards". Most likely, your parents are sitting near this sign as well, egging you on. You look at the sharks. You look at the sign. Repeat until satisfied. Repeat until you arrive at the conclusion that there is no other way but to get out of this pool in the proper state, id est, unmangled by the sharks and still breathing, still capable of continuing LIFE. This is where you realize that your initial excitement is nothing but the manifestation of hidden feelings of self-hatred and disgust stemming from the sociopathic urges you''ve had and repressed as a child. Not wonderful.\r\n\r\nIf my imagery allows, Physics is like another pool inside this UP-pool. Physics IS NOT a shark. It is another pool (inside this this pool, yes) which you are just so excited to toss yourself into at first glance but realize that you want to get out of this freaking hell alive as soon as possible. Erm no...Physics is an eddy current that seemed wonderful at first sight, further reinforcing the conclusion that your initial excitement is nothing but the manifestation of hidden feelings of self-hatred and disgust stemming from the sociopathic urges you''ve had and repressed as a child. Who else, aside from an atoning sociopath, would find the idea of tossing himself into an eddy current exciting? Dante shouldn''t have bothered describing the grotesque, the disgusting. He should''ve made them study Physics.\r\n\r\nDespite that, Physics remains to be a wonderful foil for our intuition as well as for mathematical induction. Mathematical induction won''t always work in Physics. Mathematical induction is a poor way to conclude your experiments in Physics.

(107, 1, '2012-12-29 17:07:46', '2012-12-29 17:07:46', 'UP is like an invitation-only swimming pool on a blazing summer day. The moment you learn that you have received an invitation, you get so excited you''d want to jump straight in. And jump straight in you do, not minding the initial discouragement provided by long queues. Your body makes a cold splash into the surface and underneath you go. The water is cool. You smile in between segments of underwater respiration. You cherish the smooth feel the enveloping water gives. Wonderful.\n\nAnd when your lungful of air is over, you break through the film of the surface once more, this time around attacking it from below. You look back and you realize that you''re already quite far from the shore. Must''ve been quite a dive eh? Then someone taps you and points forward. You see sharks. You try to turn back but then this person who pointed the sharks points to a sign saying "No swimming backwards". Most likely, your parents are sitting near this sign as well, egging you on. You look at the sharks. You look at the sign. Repeat until satisfied. Repeat until you arrive at the conclusion that there is no other way but to get out of this pool in the proper state, id est, unmangled by the sharks and still breathing, still capable of continuing LIFE. This is where you realize that your initial excitement is nothing but the manifestation of hidden feelings of self-hatred and disgust stemming from the sociopathic urges you''ve had and repressed as a child. Not wonderful.\n\nIf my imagery allows, Physics is like another pool inside this UP-pool. Physics IS NOT a shark. It is another pool (inside this this pool, yes) which you are just so excited to toss yourself into at first glance but realize that you want to get out of this freaking hell alive as soon as possible. Erm no...Physics is an eddy current that seemed wonderful at first sight, further reinforcing the conclusion that your initial excitement is nothing but the manifestation of hidden feelings of self-hatred and disgust stemming from the sociopathic urges you''ve had and repressed as a child. Who else, aside from an atoning sociopath, would find the idea of tossing himself into an eddy current exciting? Dante shouldn''t have bothered describing the grotesque, the disgusting. He should''ve made them study Physics.\n\nDespite that, Physics remains to be a wonderful foil for our intuition as well as for mathematical induction. Mathematical induction won''t always work in Physics. Mathematical induction is a poor way to conclude your experiments in Physics. Physics defies first impressions and base cases.\n\nPhysics is one of the things we should be thankful for. When was the last time you thanked gravity for rain fall? I thank friction for making rappelling possible, angular momentum for spinning kicks and electronics for computers.

This has been largely responsible why the past midterm season went by me without much hassle on my part. Ever since my internship, I''ve started my weeks planning ahead what I want to achieve and then tallying myself. I try to achieve at least 70% of the goals I set weekly and I''m pretty good at it; I usually get my 70% done, until recently, that is.\r\n\r\nBut before I proceed telling you about what''s been keeping me busy this past few weeks, allow me to backtrack a little and relate an interesting event I forgot to relate and that happened all because of my birthday last month. In an age where Facebook has kindly been reminding everyone of everyone else''s birthday, I pusposedly set my account to tell no one when my birthday is. As I expected, I didn''t get much greetings on my birthday. I had maybe around 3, all coming in at the last minute of August 8, two through Facebook and one via text message. And then the next few days became quite amusing, as people learned that I celebrated my birthday on the 8th. People wrote me uber-interesting greetings, starkly personal, if I may say, even if not by Facebook standards, going well up to a week after my actual birthday. True enough, I didn''t get as much greetings than if I allowed my birthday alarm to ring but I''m pretty sure that I got the better deal by receiving messages that is not the generic "Happy Birthday Chad! &lt;maybe insert smiley here&gt;".\r\n\r\nAnyway...so, what I''ve been up to. These past few weeks, my 70%-goal-achievement productivity saw a sharp drop as I found myself alternating only between two interesting projects: my thesis and my EEE8 project. This is my second take on EEE8; I don''t think I was able to tell the blog that I failed it last year largely because it was eclipsed by more personal failures, which took center stage in my posts. Back then, I never thought I''d ever even be remotely interested in breadboards, integrated circuits, and wires. But well, here I am, thinking of how can I build a robot to automate the cleaning process of my room.\r\n\r\nAs for my thesis, I must admit that one of the many reasons I wanted to join UPD''s Computer Vision and Machine Intelligence Group (CVMIG) was because I knew that I''d probably be working on image processing, which was, back in high school my idea of the pinnacle of programming. Well I got my wish, but that is not to say that I am not having a hard time in the task set to us. For some weeks now, I''ve been contemplating over the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabor_filter" target="_blank">Gabor filter</a> and I must say that I''m still pretty far from what I hope I''ve achieved with it already.\r\n\r\nWell, that''s all for now.

Just give me time to kick the hell out of the coming hell weeks...\n\nThere is one productivity trick that I''ve learned from my internship which I''ve continued to apply even well after I''m out of it: plan ahead <i>not</i> what you want to do but what you want to <i>achieve</i>. This has been largely responsible why the past midterm season went by me without much hassle on my part. Ever since my internship, I''ve started my weeks planning ahead what I want to achieve and then tallying myself. I try to achieve at least 70% of the goals I set weekly and I''m pretty good at it; I usually get my 70% done, until recently, that is.\n\nBut before I proceed telling you about what''s been keeping me busy this past few weeks, allow me to backtrack a little and relate an interesting event I forgot to relate and that happened all because of my birthday last month. In an age where Facebook has kindly been reminding everyone of everyone else''s birthday, I pusposedly set my account to tell no one when my birthday is. As I expected, I didn''t get much greetings on my birthday. I had maybe around 3, all coming in at the last minute of August 8, two through Facebook and one via text message. And then the next few days became quite amusing, as people learned that I celebrated my birthday on the 8th. People wrote me uber-interesting greetings, starkly personal, if I may say, even if not by Facebook standards, going well up to a week after my actual birthday. True enough, I didn''t get as much greetings than if I allowed my birthday alarm to ring but I''m pretty sure that I got the better deal by receiving messages that is not the generic "Happy Birthday Chad! &lt;maybe insert smiley here&gt;".\n\nAnyway...so, what I''ve been up to. These past few weeks, my 70%-goal-achievement productivity saw a sharp drop as I found myself alternating only between two interesting projects: my thesis and my EEE8 project. This is my second take on EEE8; I don''t think I was able to tell the blog that I failed it last year largely because it was eclipsed by more personal failures, which took center stage in my posts.

(118, 1, '2012-12-29 17:29:14', '2012-12-29 17:29:14', 'UP is like an invitation-only swimming pool on a blazing summer day. The moment you learn that you have received an invitation, you get so excited you''d want to jump straight in. And jump straight in you do, not minding the initial discouragement provided by long queues. Your body makes a cold splash into the surface and underneath you go. The water is cool. You smile in between segments of underwater respiration. You cherish the smooth feel the enveloping water gives. Wonderful.\n\nAnd when your lungful of air is over, you break through the film of the surface once more, this time around attacking it from below. You look back and you realize that you''re already quite far from the shore. Must''ve been quite a dive eh? Then someone taps you and points forward. You see sharks. You try to turn back but then this person who pointed the sharks points to a sign saying "No swimming backwards". Most likely, your parents are sitting near this sign as well, egging you on. You look at the sharks. You look at the sign. Repeat until satisfied. Repeat until you arrive at the conclusion that there is no other way but to get out of this pool in the proper state, id est, unmangled by the sharks and still breathing, still capable of continuing LIFE. This is where you realize that your initial excitement is nothing but the manifestation of hidden feelings of self-hatred and disgust stemming from the sociopathic urges you''ve had and repressed as a child. Not wonderful.\n\nIf my imagery allows, Physics is like another pool inside this UP-pool. Physics IS NOT a shark. It is another pool (inside this this pool, yes) which you are just so excited to toss yourself into at first glance but realize that you want to get out of this freaking hell alive as soon as possible. Erm no...Physics is an eddy current that seemed wonderful at first sight, further reinforcing the conclusion that your initial excitement is nothing but the manifestation of hidden feelings of self-hatred and disgust stemming from the sociopathic urges you''ve had and repressed as a child. Who else, aside from an atoning sociopath, would find the idea of tossing himself into an eddy current exciting? Dante shouldn''t have bothered describing the grotesque, the disgusting. He should''ve made them study Physics.\n\nDespite that, Physics remains to be a wonderful foil for our intuition as well as for mathematical induction. Mathematical induction won''t always work in Physics. Mathematical induction is a poor way to conclude your experiments in Physics. Physics defies first impressions and base cases.\n\nPhysics is one of the things we should be thankful for. When was the last time you thanked gravity for rain fall? I thank friction for making rappelling possible, angular momentum for spinning kicks and electronics for computers. One of the good things inside this eddy current is that you get the right perspective to appreciate these simple gifts from natural laws.\n\n[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="614"]<a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2515/3848374032_a667e10575_b.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2515/3848374032_a667e10575_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a> Thank you friction![/caption]\n\n<hr noshade="noshade" />\n\nWhat is the direction of the induced electric field in the reference frame of the rod shown in the figure at the right?\n<ol type="a">\n	<li>Up<a href="http://localhost/skytreader.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/physics_diagram.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-106" alt="physics_diagram" src="http://localhost/skytreader.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/physics_diagram.jpg" width="188" height="181" /></a></li>\n	<li>Into the page</li>\n	<li>Out of the page</li>\n	<li>To the left</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr noshade="noshade" />\n\nNonetheless, with all the gratitude it makes me realize, I must admit that Physics is one subject that I''d like to get done with as soon as possible.
