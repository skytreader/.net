I&#8217;m very happy that last Lantern Parade is indeed my last (as an undergraduate student of Computer Science, at least). And I&#8217;m more than happy to have graduated on time despite more than a few hitches in my trip.</p>\n<p>For two consecutive days I braved the heat of graduation ceremonies in aÂ <i>barong tagalog</i>. It was, after all, for these ceremonies that I shared with my fellow (ex-?)students that I swallowed the unfair mismanagement of our undergraduate research project. But everyday I wake up after being judged to know, ummmm, &#8220;BS Computer Science&#8221;, I am always reminded that the ceremonies didn&#8217;t matter and were but mere formalities. It was the gradual steps we took towards graduation which (hopefully) made us deserving of what they conferred on us.</p>\n<p>I almost found myself crying after receiving my diploma that I found it difficult to smile for the photographs. Finally, after four years, I get to clean my room and my computer of all the accumulated &#8220;proofs of passing&#8221; I&#8217;ve been saving as a contingency plan, in case some disputes about my grades arise in the near future. Even right now, it is with great awe that I behold my passing grades in Discrete Math and Physics 72. Well, you never know.</p>\n<p>And because, thank thesis, it&#8217;s been over two months since I last posted here, I&#8217;m still too lazy to give anything coherent; I&#8217;m still catching up on missed sleep, missed games, and missed personal projects. So we eat up the rest of the space with my tips on how to make living on this rock we call the Earth a worthwhile endeavor.</p>\n<p><strong>Read books.</strong>Â Seriously. And I don&#8217;t just mean that you meticulously read ahead of this week&#8217;s lecture at school. I mean to say that you go out of your way and find books that will take you to worlds undiscovered and will bring you thoughts to ponder. The human civilization may be young compared to some alien culture lurking just behind the neighboring galaxies but we have already accumulated quite a trove of wisdom and almost all of them are recorded in books.</p>\n<p>Almost.</p>\n<p><strong>Have real-life adventures.</strong>Â Travel when and where you can. Take unknown paths. Do things without always knowing how they&#8217;ll turn out. This is how you&#8217;ll accumulate wisdom for yourself. You&#8217;ll surely be missing out a lot if you don&#8217;t read books but never ever forget that your life is one huge book-in-the-works as well and it will be such a shame to look back one day, realizing that your book is empty or well-written but unread. I am pleased to say that during my four years at college I&#8217;ve had my fair share of these adventures. Wish I took more field trips, though. I&#8217;m looking forward for more.</p>\n<p><strong>Make mistakes.</strong>Â Waste your time. You&#8217;ll thank yourself for it. If that book you are writing isn&#8217;t full of erasures you are most probably not trying out a lot of things. Don&#8217;t follow tried-and-tested recipes. That is not how you&#8217;ll learn.</p>\n<p><strong>Be aware of what you don&#8217;t know.</strong>Â And I assure you this will save your skin. And the skin of the people tossed with you in this adventure. Being aware of what you don&#8217;t know will help you make sense of your mistakes. You will be better prepared next time. Hallelujah to the things we don&#8217;t know.</p>\n<p>And lastly,</p>\n<p><strong>Do not listen to every advice thrown your way.</strong>Â I have come to accept that life, unlike research, does not require a theoretical framework for you to move forward. All you need is some nerve and, believe you me, you will be surprised how often this Universe/Fate/Destiny/Karma/God rewards raw nerve. Not always, but more often than what other people will have you believe. It is alright to just make things up as you go. No one will take it against you.</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:63:"http://localhost/skytreader.net/journal/for-what-its-worth/feed";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:54:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:19:"Palawan Photography";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"http://localhost/skytreader.net/journal/palawan-photography";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"http://localhost/skytreader.net/journal/palawan-photography#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 29 Jan 2012 08:39:05 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Photography";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"adventures";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:19:"alliterations again";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"palawan";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"paradise";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37:"http://localhost/skytreader.net/?p=24";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:457:"The waves rock our boat, turning our reef-hopping trip to an amusement-park feel joyride of sorts.

An island, sun-soaked for everyone to see its lush, appears on the horizon. I take aim with my lens but, as I make sure that I have set the proper shutter speed to negate the wildness of waves, I acknowledge that, for the first time, my camera has proved insufficient for this adventure.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. My camera performed as admirably as ever, taking shots as sharp as usual, limited only by the hands and eyes wielding it. But, as all cameras do, it could not record the feelings that made the trip impressible in memory. True, it recorded the beauty I saw of Palawan but it cannot capture the smell of adventure as we battled the waves, the flavor of sea-side air, nor that sun soaked smell served as my perfume for almost the whole time we stayed there.</p>\n<p>I got into Palawan courtesy of the undergraduate research I am doing. Our project, Porites recognition, is part of a larger project in UPD. The researchers involved in the project went to Palawan to gather data. My role isn&#8217;t really field-related but I got included anyway.</p>\n<p>Despite it being a research trip, it was adventure all throughout, from the waves to the food to the exploration of the city&#8217;s night spirit. The first day we rocked the waves, we ran short of fuel. We waited on a sandbar for further instructions. It&#8217;s beautiful, dreamy in quality, if not for the fact that it is a graveyard of corals damaged by dynamites. It is a peaceful spot in the middle of the sea nonetheless, as the resting place of innocent creatures should be.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Stranded" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6774873597/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Stranded" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7165/6774873597_773bdec527.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Taking a Respite from the Sea''s Immensity" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6774881245/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Taking a Respite from the Sea''s Immensity" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7026/6774881245_e04da4eb28.jpg" width="500" height="113" /></a></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Abandoned" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6774856303/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Abandoned" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7159/6774856303_a82364662b.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\n<p>I tried to travel as light as possible being that (1) it is generally a good idea to travel light, (2) pretty men travel light and (3) I did not want too much of my personal stuff to get in the way of the research equipment we brought along.

It would&#8217;ve been fine until they took a fancy to my camera and I became an official photodocumanitarian of sorts.</p>\n<p>I got all my pictures back to Manila safe and sound but I learned a valuable lesson nonetheless: the pictures I take belong to the people who made the shot, whether they are distinguishable/included or not in the final output, as much as it belongs to me. I should&#8217;ve been more responsible for our shared property.

Not unless you have your own lighting equipment. But (a) I don&#8217;t have that and (b) that looks too out-of-place, space-taking, and inconsiderate for an event like the Lantern Parade.</li>\n<li>Unlike a point-and-shoot&#8217;s flash, which fires the lights straight at your subject, an SLR fires flash upwards, assuming there is a ceiling to bounce the light downwards, diffused. This results to a better effect/less glare. There obviously isn&#8217;t a ceiling equivalent inÂ <i>outdoors</i>, Lanter Parade set-up. I had to use my hands to direct the flash to my subjects (hood it over the flash like a &#8220;ceiling&#8221; which will quickly catch the lights and bounce it towards your subject). Thank goodness I realized this quickly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, as it was getting dark at this point, it became harder to get decent shots. Lighting was no longer on my side as I was already relying on flash. Otherwise, it&#8217;d be too dark or too orange depending on where I decide to shoot.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Wall-E" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526288615/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Wall-E" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7169/6526288615_149dd71673.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\n<p><a title="The DCS contingent" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526300709/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="The DCS contingent" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7142/6526300709_5753471da0.jpg" /></a></p>\n<div>Above pictured is Eng&#8217;g''s Wall-E, one of our lanterns, and the DCS/Cursor contingent of the Parade. Like last year, Eng&#8217;g scored with a particularly awesomazing lantern followed by aâwait for itâ<i><b>boring</b></i>Â march of Eng&#8217;g orgs and banners. My sister, who majors in Broadcast Communication, likens it toÂ <i>dead air</i>Â i.e., awkward and should-be-avoided pauses in radio productions. Unlike the last three years though, they, at least, weren&#8217;t wearing orange. Plus points for the fashion factor!</div>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Belly Dancers 1" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526312523/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Belly Dancers 1" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7165/6526312523_3940c75595.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\n<p><a title="Belly Dancers 2" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526328455/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Belly Dancers 2" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7002/6526328455_0f3c95ee95.jpg" /></a></p>\n<p><a title="The Fire" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526335201/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="The Fire" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7016/6526335201_9315e7c980.jpg" /></a></p>\n<div>I took this shot from one of the torches of the Beta Sigma frat men. Their first number was the human chain/snake which I believe is part of their initiation rights. Even if it is my second time seeing this, it was still kind of chilling especially with their chant. I heard someone (was he from Î²Ï?) call their second partÂ <i>kata</i>Â which is the Karate equivalent of Taekwondo&#8217;sÂ <i>poomsae</i>Â or forms. While their formation and synchronicity might look watch-worthy, it didn&#8217;t really catch my attention (maybe &#8217;cause I&#8217;ve seen better during my TKD days). So, my eyes were wandering off to better photo-ops, their torch flames in particular.

Brock was making rice cakes when Ash noticed a camera lens (wanting to take a picture of Pikachu) appear from behind some bushes. He over-reacted, imagining it to fire a laser projectile of sorts, and ruined their little rice cake picnic. I&#8217;ve never been able to shake that episode from my mind since I watched it as a kid.</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"http://localhost/skytreader.net/journal/lovely-lantern-lights/feed";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:54:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:23:"The Last One, Hopefully";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"http://localhost/skytreader.net/journal/the-last-one-hopefully";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"http://localhost/skytreader.net/journal/the-last-one-hopefully#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 30 Nov 2011 18:35:41 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Reflections";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"UP Life";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"beginnings";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"lookbacks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"yes the jason mraz is that awesome";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37:"http://localhost/skytreader.net/?p=60";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:508:"Second semesters.

I had to recharge by doing nothing and watching my first concert ever, starred by the Jason Mraz.</p>\n<p>An amusing aspect of this second semester is how I encounter my past teachers. Imagine casually meeting your first math teacher in college ever, remembering that his subject was your baptism by fire, and wondering if he remembers you or if you should maybe greet or wave or something. Even after Math 17 I didn&#8217;t really become that awesome in math. But, if anything, Math 17 gave me the tenacity I&#8217;d use during those countless times I went on the brink of failure. I still have to encounter a non-theoretical application of the complex plane, numeric progressions, and root finding but Math 17 was most worthwhile taking even if just for the mindset I gained.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s only been four years and yet it all seems so long. Maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve actually had eight sets of subjects just for the past four years? And that&#8217;s not counting my summer semesters.</p>\n<p>Another amusement: my candidate last semester is host to a number of firsts in my life. It is my first underloaded semester, being that all those summers spent in school has finally paid off and I&#8217;m only 13 units away from my diploma (15 to around 21 is the range of normal load, variable depending on whether you have laboratory units). But wait, no, it is also my first semester taking a Master&#8217;s class. Out of curiousity and a desire not to slack off/underload, I added a further three units to the missing 13 units of my undergraduate curriculum.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m closer than ever to closing this volume of my life, but it&#8217;s not a clear coast yet. I still have an obstacle course and a thesis to finish. But hey I&#8217;m already here. So just you wait.</p>\n<p>See you!</p>\n<p>P.S. Greet the blog a happy birthday!

I&#8217;ll miss your compact feel, how I can carry you everyday, except when my bag is too crowded already.</div>\n<p>I&#8217;m not really a fan of anime but I&#8217;m quite a huge fan of BLEACH!. Those who know their BLEACH! will know from where did I pattern the name &#8220;Getsurikai&#8221;. It isn&#8217;t very clean Japanese from what I&#8217;ve been told but hey, I like the sound of it so I&#8217;m taking artistic license. And oh, it literally means &#8220;moon grasp&#8221; by the way.</p>\n<p>These past few days, I&#8217;ve been busy trying to get the feel for it. So far, the biggest adjustment I had to make is the placement of controls. Whereas my old Kodak has all controls at the right-hand side, Getsurikai has it both in the left and right-hand side. Kodak has its shooting mode settings on a dial around the shutter button but that is where Getsurikai has its on/off switch, the shooting modes being in a dial at the left of the viewfinder. Imagine what happened the first time I (instinctively) tried to switch modes? Hooha.</p>\n<p>But I quickly got over that problem and I&#8217;m pretty comfortable with where all the controls are located now. What I&#8217;m currently doing is trying to learn all its features before December&#8217;sÂ <a title="Year Three" href="http://localhost/skytreader.net/journal/year-three">Lantern Parade</a>, which is, if you need to be made aware, a photographer&#8217;s idea of a shooting feast.</p>\n<p>They&#8217;re not much yet but here are some of the results of my test drive.</p>\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a title="Aperture Experiments" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6275215021/" target="_blank"><img alt="Aperture Experiments" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6060/6275215021_cbaeea313b.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Just experimenting with aperture settings&#8230;</p></div>\n<div></div>\n<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a title="Art Found" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6275221317/" target="_blank"><img alt="Art Found" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6035/6275221317_8dc8fc821e.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Art found in the construction.

Just give me time to kick the hell out of the coming hell weeks&#8230;</p>\n<p>There is one productivity trick that I&#8217;ve learned from my internship which I&#8217;ve continued to apply even well after I&#8217;m out of it: plan aheadÂ <i>not</i>Â what you want to do but what you want toÂ <i>achieve</i>. This has been largely responsible why the past midterm season went by me without much hassle on my part. Ever since my internship, I&#8217;ve started my weeks planning ahead what I want to achieve and then tallying myself. I try to achieve at least 70% of the goals I set weekly and I&#8217;m pretty good at it; I usually get my 70% done, until recently, that is.</p>\n<p>But before I proceed telling you about what&#8217;s been keeping me busy this past few weeks, allow me to backtrack a little and relate an interesting event I forgot to relate and that happened all because of my birthday last month. In an age where Facebook has kindly been reminding everyone of everyone else&#8217;s birthday, I pusposedly set my account to tell no one when my birthday is. As I expected, I didn&#8217;t get much greetings on my birthday. I had maybe around 3, all coming in at the last minute of August 8, two through Facebook and one via text message. And then the next few days became quite amusing, as people learned that I celebrated my birthday on the 8th. People wrote me uber-interesting greetings, starkly personal, if I may say, even if not by Facebook standards, going well up to a week after my actual birthday. True enough, I didn&#8217;t get as much greetings than if I allowed my birthday alarm to ring but I&#8217;m pretty sure that I got the better deal by receiving messages that is not the generic &#8220;Happy Birthday Chad! &lt;maybe insert smiley here&gt;&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Anyway&#8230;so, what I&#8217;ve been up to. These past few weeks, my 70%-goal-achievement productivity saw a sharp drop as I found myself alternating only between two interesting projects: my thesis and my EEE8 project. This is my second take on EEE8; I don&#8217;t think I was able to tell the blog that I failed it last year largely because it was eclipsed by more personal failures, which took center stage in my posts. Back then, I never thought I&#8217;d ever even be remotely interested in breadboards, integrated circuits, and wires. But well, here I am, thinking of how can I build a robot to automate the cleaning process of my room.</p>\n<p>As for my thesis, I must admit that one of the many reasons I wanted to join UPD&#8217;s Computer Vision and Machine Intelligence Group (CVMIG) was because I knew that I&#8217;d probably be working on image processing, which was, back in high school my idea of the pinnacle of programming. Well I got my wish, but that is not to say that I am not having a hard time in the task set to us. For some weeks now, I&#8217;ve been contemplating over theÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabor_filter" target="_blank">Gabor filter</a>Â and I must say that I&#8217;m still pretty far from what I hope I&#8217;ve achieved with it already.</p>\n<p>Well, that&#8217;s all for now. Wish me luck and see you soon in Paradise, wherever or whatever that is&#8230;~Your Skymeister.</p>\n<p><a href="http://localhost/skytreader.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/heaven.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-115" alt="heaven" src="http://localhost/skytreader.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/heaven.jpg" width="704" height="490" /></a></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:90:"http://localhost/skytreader.net/journal/photography-of-the-month-reach-up-to-paradise/feed";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:57:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Photograph of the Month: Futsal";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"http://localhost/skytreader.net/journal/photograph-of-the-month-futsal";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"http://localhost/skytreader.net/journal/photograph-of-the-month-futsal#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 30 Aug 2011 17:14:16 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:6:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Life in General";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Photography";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"UP Life";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"futsal";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:23:"photograph of the month";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"taekwondo";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:38:"http://localhost/skytreader.net/?p=108";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:493:"Why am I a photoblog all of a sudden?Â Read about it here.

Well people, that isÂ <i>American</i>Â Football. America, to avoid confusion, calls that sport in which Spain prevailed in last year&#8217;s World CupÂ <i>Soccer</i>. Elsewhere it is Football and&#8230;uh&#8230;Handegg?</p>\n<p>Because I really can&#8217;t make a ball out of that egg-shaped pork-skin, I&#8217;ll be with the rest of the world in this matter and sayÂ <i>Spain won in theÂ <b>Football</b>Â World Cup</i>.</p>\n<p>For as long as I can remember, I wanted to play Football. I remember kicking softdrink tin cans with friends way back in elementary, being that we had no Football equipment and that softdrink tin cans were just perfect in weight if not in shape. Even as relatives and teachers thought I&#8217;d be playing Basketball due to my growth spurt when I was young, I kept dreaming of green fields and goals.</p>\n<p>My elementary school had no varsity teams. So, when I moved to a new school for high school, I really looked forward to playing a sport. But alas, the high school I moved to had varsity teams, alright, but not Football. Our space was pretty cramped, you see, that sometimes even the Basketball team had to practice half-court since the other half was being sharedÂ <i>between two other sports</i>Â (giving them a quarter-court&#8217;s share each).</p>\n<p>And I thought I&#8217;d end up in Basketball finally, and make my teachers and relatives happy for a prediction-turned-right. But then, my high school hadÂ <b>Taekwondo</b>. I trained for the whole four years of my high school.</p>\n<p>Those four years weren&#8217;t exactly the most injury-free but they were definitely character-forming. It&#8217;s thanks to Taekwondo that I developed a habit for sports and working out. It also taught me how to push-through with what I want to achieve and to give my 110% in the things I do.</p>\n<p>Come college, I knew that I wouldn&#8217;t have enough time to practice a sport regularly.

Maybe I did but that was only at the start of my college career; when I saw how chaotic things can get I started considering doing it with a group, a consideration I held on to until I received the email welcoming me to the research lab I applied to. My name was there, at the top, alone in it&#8217;s line, unaccompanied by those whom I contacted as group matesâa solo flight ticket. &#8220;Chad,&#8221; says Neil, a gifted artist I hang around with, &#8220;if you need a crying shoulder anytime this coming year, we&#8217;re here.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In my renewed sense of optimism and belief in reasons reason does not know, I can&#8217;t help but feel that doing my thesis alone is a challenge especially meant for me. Back in high school, I always dreamed of the time I get to make a system on my own, large enough to make a decent dent on a CD&#8217;s 700MB worth of storage space. I don&#8217;t know how large do theses get but I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ll be exceeding the line count of the spaghetti behind<a href="http://gradegrid.skytreader.net/" target="_blank">GradeGrid</a>Â or the 1087 lines of code behind the programming language I created for my Programming Laguages class.

I clocked in around 281 hours and 52 minutes in around 7 weeks. I created a timer program that will keep track of how many hours do I spend working on something, inspired by an internal tool from Azeus. I&#8217;ll be timing how much time will I spend on my thesis.

The WordPress community is stronger than ever, and some of the accomplishments of the past year are definitely worth remembering.</p>\n<h4>Software Releases</h4>\n<p>We had two major releases of the WordPress web application with versions <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/06/green/">3.4</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/12/elvin/">3.5</a>, as well as 5 security releases during 2012. 3.4 included the theme customizer, while 3.5 became the long awaited &#8220;media release&#8221; featuring a new uploader and gallery management tool.Â 3.5 contained code contributions from more people than ever, and we hope to continue growing the contributor ranks in the year ahead.Â We currently have native apps on 6 mobile platforms &#8212; <a href="http://ios.wordpress.org/">iOS</a>, <a href="http://android.wordpress.org/">Android</a>, <a href="http://blackberry.wordpress.org/">Blackberry</a>, <a href="http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/">Windows Phone</a>, <a href="http://nokia.wordpress.org/">Nokia</a>, and <a href="http://webos.wordpress.org/">WebOS</a> &#8212; and saw several updates there as well.</p>\n<h4>Plugin Directory</h4>\n<p>A number of improvements were made to the Plugin Directory in 2012. More cosmetic Â updates, like the introduction of branded plugin page headers, make it a nicer browsing experience, while functional changes like better-integrated support forums, plugin reviews, and a favorites system made the plugin directory even more useful as a resource.</p>\n<h4>The &#8220;Make&#8221; Network and Team Reps</h4>\n<p>2012 was the year that saw the creation of <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/">Make.wordpress.org</a>, a network of sites for the teams of contributors responsible for the different areas of the WordPress project. Now anyone can follow along and get involved with the teams that work on <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/">core</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/themes/">theme review</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/support/">forum support</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/">documentation</a>, and more. In 2013 we&#8217;ll work to improve these sites to make it easier to become a contributor. Each team also now has elected Team Reps, a new role that has already led to more cross-team communication. Team reps post each week to the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/updates/">Updates blog</a> so that the other reps can keep up with what&#8217;s going on in other teams.</p>\n<h4>WordPress Community Summit</h4>\n<p>At the end of October, about 100 of the most influential and respected members of the WordPress community attended an inaugural <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/summit">summit</a> to discuss where we all stand, and to figure out where we go next with WordPress. A &#8220;conference of conversations,&#8221; this unconference made everyone an active participant, and while not every issue brought to the table was solved by the end of the event, the right questions were being asked.</p>\n<h4>Meetup.com</h4>\n<p>The WordPress Foundation now has a central account with Meetup.com. We&#8217;ve brought in a couple dozen existing meetup groups as a pilot to test the system, and are in the process of working with more existing meetups (as well as new ones) to join us so that local organizers won&#8217;t have to pay organizer dues and can get more support from the WordPress project.</p>\n<h4>Internet Blackout Day</h4>\n<p>We participated in the protest against SOPA/PIPA, Internet Blackout Day, on January 18. Though we usually stay out of politics, this campaign was important, and we not only participated in the blackout on WordPress.org, we encouraged our users to do so as well, and recommended plugins to provide blackout functionality. It was deemed the <a href="http://sopastrike.com/numbers/">largest online protest in history</a>.</p>\n<h4>WordCamps</h4>\n<p>And finally, it wouldn&#8217;t be a recap without counting up the <a href="http://wordcamp.org">WordCamps</a>! There were 67 WordCamps around the world in 2012, bringing together WordPress users, developers, and fans. If you didn&#8217;t make it to a WordCamp this year, maybe it can be one of your new year resolutions: <a href="http://central.wordcamp.org/schedule/">check the schedule</a> to find one near you!</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/01/2012-a-look-back/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:42:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:25:"WordPress 3.5 âElvinâ";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40:"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/12/elvin/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:49:"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/12/elvin/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:54:23 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2517";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:363:"It&#8217;s the most wonderful time of the year: a new WordPress release is available and chock-full of goodies to delight bloggers and developers alike.

Media has long been a friction point and we&#8217;ve listened hard and given a lot of thought into crafting this new system. 3.5 includes a new default theme, Twenty Twelve, which has a very clean mobile-first responsive design and works fantastic as a base for a CMS site. Finally we&#8217;ve spent a lot of time refreshing the styles of the dashboard, updating everything to be Retina-ready with beautiful high resolution graphics, a new color picker, and streamlining a couple of fewer-used sections of the admin.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a quick video overview of everything you can share with your friends:</p>\n<div id="v-jQDfEbzZ-1" class="video-player"><embed id="v-jQDfEbzZ-1-video" src="http://s0.videopress.com/player.swf?v=1.03&amp;guid=jQDfEbzZ&amp;isDynamicSeeking=true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="692" height="388" title="Introducing WordPress 3.5" wmode="direct" seamlesstabbing="true" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" overstretch="true"></embed></div>\n<h3>For Developers</h3>\n<p>You can now put your (or anyone&#8217;s) WordPress.org username on the plugins page and see your favorite tagged ones, to make it easy to install them again when setting up a new site. There&#8217;s a new Tumblr importer. New installs no longer show the links manager. Finally for multisite developers <code>switch_to_blog()</code> is way faster and you can now install MS in a sub-directory. The <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore</a> and <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> JavaScript libraries are now available. <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.5">The Codex has a pretty good summary of the developer features above and beyond this</a>, and you can always <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/3.5">grab a warm beverage and explore Trac directly</a>.</p>\n<h3>Percussion Section</h3>\n<p>Behind every great release is great contributors. 3.5 had more people involved than any release before it:</p>\n<p><a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/aaroncampbell">Aaron D.

(<a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21812">#21812</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Posts API:Â </strong>Major performance improvements when working with hierarchies of pages and post ancestors.

That is something I hope this group will change, and the local organizers can be recognized for the community leaders they are.*</p>\n<p>If you are the organizer of a local WordCamp, WordPress meetup, etc., head over toÂ <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/events/">http://make.wordpress.org/events/</a> and introduce yourself so we can include you in the fun!</p>\n<p>Speaking of meetups, an update on <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/01/year-of-the-meetup/">my last post about meetups</a> is long overdue. With around 500 meetup organizers (and/or potential organizers) responding to my last survey, it took much longer than anticipated to review all the responses. We&#8217;re working now with meetup.com to issue invitations to join a centralized WordPress Meetup account, so if you filled out the form earlier this year, you should be hearing from them soon. The first wave of existing meetup account transfers (for those who opted in) should happen in the next two weeks, with additional waves every 3 months thereafter (and new groups will be able to be created along the way).</p>\n<p>The <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/05/calling-all-contributors-community-summit-2012/">contributor summit</a> that is being planned for the end of October also generated hundreds of responses/nominations, so that review process is still happening, but we should be announcing some basic plans and issuing invitations soon.</p>\n<p>And finally, it would be impossible to talk about in-person WordPress events without mentioning the upcoming annual <a href="http://2012.sf.wordcamp.org">WordCamp in San Francisco</a>. As the event that represents the worldwide project as a whole, it&#8217;s the perfect time to evaluate where we stand as a project and as a community, to help determine where we go next. If you&#8217;re a WordPress user, developer, or in any way a part of our vast and interconnected ecosystem, please take a moment to fill inÂ the <a href="http://wpsurvey.polldaddy.com/s/wp-2012">2nd annual WordPress survey</a>. It&#8217;s just a couple of questions, and your input would be greatly appreciated. The results of the survey will be announced at <a href="http://2012.sf.wordcamp.org">WSCF</a>, and a report issued shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p>*<em> I am also of the firm belief that academic and arts activities should earn varsity letters just like sports teams do &#8212; go mathletes!Â </em></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/07/event-organizers-unite/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:4:"href";s:31:"http://wordpress.org/news/feed/";s:3:"rel";s:4:"self";s:4:"type";s:19:"application/rss+xml";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:44:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/";a:2:{s:12:"updatePeriod";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"hourly";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:15:"updateFrequency";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:8:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Sun, 13 Jan 2013 04:38:35 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:23:"text/xml; charset=UTF-8";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:10:"x-pingback";s:36:"http://wordpress.org/news/xmlrpc.php";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Tue, 01 Jan 2013 02:22:20 GMT";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT luv 139";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20121222040105";}', 'no');

networking web services.</p>\n<p>Earlier this morning, I was checking Facebook from my phone, and saw a notification of someone Liking one of my entries. I clicked through to see what it was, and it was a link to a post here on this blog. Facebook didn&#8217;t have an excerpt, just a link, so I followed the link to my blog to see what it was. It turned out to just contain another link, which was a shortened URL, so I clicked through to see where it led. It turned out that it linked to <em>another</em> entry here on my blog. And that entry contained another link. Which led to <strong><em>another</em></strong> entry on my blog, again, with a link. A couple more levels deep, I eventually got to an entry that was an automated cross-post to my blog, generated by a checkin on Foursquare.</p>\n<p><span id="more-72398"></span>About the time I was realizing what was happening, I got a notification from my phone that someone had mentioned me on Twitter.

feature set to post links to my new blog posts on <a href="https://twitter.com/dougal">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dougal.campbell">Facebook</a>, and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/dougal">LinkedIn</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And thus, a loop: Link posted on Twitter, picked up by Delicious; Delicious bookmark picked up by IFTTT and posted to my blog; Blog post picked up by JetPack, and posted to Twitter; Link posted to Twitter, picked up by Delicious, etc.</p>\n<p>The mystery is why this suddenly started happening. Because I&#8217;ve had those services set up that way for some time now. My immediate solution was to disassociate the automatic cross-posting of new blog entries to other services from the JetPack Publicize feature. But what I may end up doing instead is to disable the monitoring of links on Twitter from my Delicious account, as that function was never as selective as what I really wanted.</p>\n<p>But do you want to know who I really blame for this? It&#8217;s Twitter. Do you know why? It&#8217;s because of a change they made to their terms and conditions a while back.</p>\n<p>You see, I used to only cross-post from Twitter to my blog via the IFTTT service, by having it watch for tweets I posted specifically with the hashtag &#8216;#moblog&#8217;. But changes that Twitter made to their terms caused IFTTT to remove a lot of their Twitter functionality. So, I started using the feature in Delicious which could automatically pick up links I posted to Twitter and create bookmarks from them, instead. But since there was no limiting factor (the hashtag), it opened the door for this cross-posting loop.</p>\n<p>So there you go: it&#8217;s all Twitter&#8217;s fault.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Original Article: <a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2013/01/09/loopty-loop/">Loopty-Loop</a>\n<a href="http://dougal.gunters.org">Dougal Campbell&#039;s geek ramblings - WordPress, web development, and world domination.</a></p><div class="yarpp-related-rss yarpp-related-none">\n<h3>Related posts:</h3>\n<img src="http://yarpp.org/pixels/5db43ee24c4f1e1d0e45d08cc91b0130" />\n</div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 09 Jan 2013 16:49:06 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Dougal Campbell";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:19:"Matt: Qualcomm LOLs";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=42100";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"http://ma.tt/2013/01/qualcomm-lols/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:357:"<p>&#8220;And now there&#8217;s a Rolls Royce.

Weâre pleased to introduce version 1.9, which adds some very powerful features! Hereâs whatâs new:</p>\n<h3>Featured Images Support</h3>\n<p>Weâre happy to report that you can now upload a <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Thumbnails" target="_blank">Featured Image</a> for your blog posts as long as your theme supports it. To set an image as featured, just tap on it after adding it to the post content area and click the âfeatureâ buttonÂ â see the screenshot on the right.</p>\n<p>Note that youâll need WordPress 3.4.1 or greater and a theme that supports featured images in order to use this feature.</p>\n<h3>Full Screen Editing</h3>\n<p>Your phone has a relatively small screen and when writing a post, a large portion of it is taken up by the keyboard. While youâre not likely to write <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_Comedy" target="_blank">&#8220;The Divine Comedy&#8221;</a> on your phone, wouldnât it be great to have just a little more space? In 1.9 the content editor has its own page that fills the whole screen.</p>\n<p>When the post is ready to go, just press the back button and youâll be right back in the Post editor.</p>\n<h3>Reliability Improvements</h3>\n<p>In addition to the new features, weâve worked hard on making the app even more stable and fast. In total, almost 20 bugs and crashes have been fixed in this release. You can see the details on what was taken care of on the <a href="http://windowsphone.trac.wordpress.org/query?group=status&milestone=1.9" target="_blank">trac roadmap</a>.</p>\n<h3>Download</h3>\n<p>Ready to get the latest?

We added 48 <a href="http://automattic.com/about/">new Automatticians</a> and it&#8217;s been delightful to see the effect the new folks have had on the company. We made over 40,000 commits to our various repositories, about half of those on <a href="http://wp.com/">WP.com</a> alone. Contained in those commits are countless improvements to the experience for WP.com, but I&#8217;m just as proud of the things we removed and streamlined: the WP.com homepage has been drastically simplified, and a completely revamped reader is launching this week. Engagement started rising again after being flat in 2011. Support responses that used to take days now take hours or less.Â We <a href="https://www.quantcast.com/p-18-mFEk4J448M">added 75M uniques</a> to our our network. There is a <a href="http://ios.wordpress.org/">demo WordPress app</a> on every iPhone and iPad in every Apple store I&#8217;ve visited in the US. (If you contribute to WordPress, show it to your friends next time you&#8217;re in a store and say &#8220;I help make this!&#8221;) We did two acquisitions, one announced, one not yet. It looks like we&#8217;ll <a href="http://automattic.com/work-with-us/">grow the team by at least another 60 people this year</a>. There&#8217;s so much more already done that hasn&#8217;t been announced yet or that&#8217;s coming that I&#8217;m bursting to share, but the surprise is at least half the fun.

There were also five security releases, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/twentytwelve">a new default theme</a>, and a record number of code contributions in <a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2012/12/11/wordpress-3-5-released/">the 3.5 release</a>.</p>\n<p>The site itself also saw some improvements, including a new plugin page design withÂ <a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2012/11/02/plugin-and-theme-reviews-are-live-on-wordpress-org/">plugin and theme reviews</a>, and <a href="http://make.wordpress.org">Make.WordPress.org</a>, a network of sites where teams and contributors can easily communicate with each other.</p>\n<p>Speaking of teams and contributors, 2012 also saw the very first <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/summit/">WordPress Community Summit</a>, a 2-day event attended by 108 of the top WordPress development, support, and overall community volunteers.</p>\n<p>2012 was certainly a big year for WordPress, and with <a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2012/12/20/wordpress-3-6-planning-underway/">planning for WordPress 3.6 already underway</a>, it looks like they&#8217;re going to hit the ground running in 2013.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~4/IhBrutIBlZc" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 01 Jan 2013 14:00:32 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"James";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:27:"Dev Blog: 2012: A Look Back";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2525";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:51:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/01/2012-a-look-back/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4440:"<p>Another year is coming to a close, and it&#8217;s time to look back and reflect on what we&#8217;ve accomplished in the past twelve months. The WordPress community is stronger than ever, and some of the accomplishments of the past year are definitely worth remembering.</p>\n<h4>Software Releases</h4>\n<p>We had two major releases of the WordPress web application with versions <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/06/green/">3.4</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2012/12/elvin/">3.5</a>, as well as 5 security releases during 2012. 3.4 included the theme customizer, while 3.5 became the long awaited &#8220;media release&#8221; featuring a new uploader and gallery management tool.Â 3.5 contained code contributions from more people than ever, and we hope to continue growing the contributor ranks in the year ahead.Â We currently have native apps on 6 mobile platforms &#8212; <a href="http://ios.wordpress.org/">iOS</a>, <a href="http://android.wordpress.org/">Android</a>, <a href="http://blackberry.wordpress.org/">Blackberry</a>, <a href="http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/">Windows Phone</a>, <a href="http://nokia.wordpress.org/">Nokia</a>, and <a href="http://webos.wordpress.org/">WebOS</a> &#8212; and saw several updates there as well.</p>\n<h4>Plugin Directory</h4>\n<p>A number of improvements were made to the Plugin Directory in 2012. More cosmetic Â updates, like the introduction of branded plugin page headers, make it a nicer browsing experience, while functional changes like better-integrated support forums, plugin reviews, and a favorites system made the plugin directory even more useful as a resource.</p>\n<h4>The &#8220;Make&#8221; Network and Team Reps</h4>\n<p>2012 was the year that saw the creation of <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/">Make.wordpress.org</a>, a network of sites for the teams of contributors responsible for the different areas of the WordPress project. Now anyone can follow along and get involved with the teams that work on <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/">core</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/themes/">theme review</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/support/">forum support</a>, <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/">documentation</a>, and more. In 2013 we&#8217;ll work to improve these sites to make it easier to become a contributor. Each team also now has elected Team Reps, a new role that has already led to more cross-team communication. Team reps post each week to the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/updates/">Updates blog</a> so that the other reps can keep up with what&#8217;s going on in other teams.</p>\n<h4>WordPress Community Summit</h4>\n<p>At the end of October, about 100 of the most influential and respected members of the WordPress community attended an inaugural <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/summit">summit</a> to discuss where we all stand, and to figure out where we go next with WordPress. A &#8220;conference of conversations,&#8221; this unconference made everyone an active participant, and while not every issue brought to the table was solved by the end of the event, the right questions were being asked.</p>\n<h4>Meetup.com</h4>\n<p>The WordPress Foundation now has a central account with Meetup.com. We&#8217;ve brought in a couple dozen existing meetup groups as a pilot to test the system, and are in the process of working with more existing meetups (as well as new ones) to join us so that local organizers won&#8217;t have to pay organizer dues and can get more support from the WordPress project.</p>\n<h4>Internet Blackout Day</h4>\n<p>We participated in the protest against SOPA/PIPA, Internet Blackout Day, on January 18. Though we usually stay out of politics, this campaign was important, and we not only participated in the blackout on WordPress.org, we encouraged our users to do so as well, and recommended plugins to provide blackout functionality. It was deemed the <a href="http://sopastrike.com/numbers/">largest online protest in history</a>.</p>\n<h4>WordCamps</h4>\n<p>And finally, it wouldn&#8217;t be a recap without counting up the <a href="http://wordcamp.org">WordCamps</a>! There were 67 WordCamps around the world in 2012, bringing together WordPress users, developers, and fans.

This is the first time I&#8217;ve ever heard about CodeGarage but they appear to be a VaultPress alternative. Looking over the pricing and plans for each service, I see that CodeGarage was definitely cheaper as you can monitor 5 websites for $25 a month while VaultPress charges a flat fee <strong>PER</strong> website. The acquisition appears to be a talent grab as well as being a learning exercise. As an example, CodeGarage has a great pricing structure that allows businesses to have multiple websites monitored for a nominal fee, something which VaultPress doesn&#8217;t have. </p>\n<p>I have to say though, I&#8217;m a bit perplexed as to why <a href="http://blog.vaultpress.com/2012/12/21/vaultpress-in-the-garage/">Automattic/VaultPress would continue</a> to build and expand upon CodeGarage considering the existence of VaultPress. Even though it was not announced, if I were a customer of CodeGarage, I&#8217;d be watching the news very carefully to watch for any hints of the service shutting down and everyone having to migrate over to the VaultPress platform. </p>\n<div class="yarpp-related-rss">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/vaultpress-not-an-option-for-non-profit-multisite-installations" rel="bookmark" title="VaultPress &#8211; Not An Option For Non-Profit MultiSite Installations?">VaultPress &#8211; Not An Option For Non-Profit MultiSite Installations?</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/vaultpress-now-supports-wordpress-multisite" rel="bookmark" title="VaultPress Now Supports WordPress Multisite">VaultPress Now Supports WordPress Multisite</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/vaultpress-issues-first-set-of-invites" rel="bookmark" title="VaultPress Issues First Set Of Invites">VaultPress Issues First Set Of Invites</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/yVmq2R5GpIk" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 28 Dec 2012 20:20:41 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:40:"WP Windows Phone 7: Version 1.8 Released";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/?p=314";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2012/12/07/version-1-8/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2749:"<p><a href="http://wpwindowsphone.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/wpwindowsphone-1-8-comment-moderation.png"><img src="http://wpwindowsphone.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/wpwindowsphone-1-8-comment-moderation.png?w=300&h=560" alt="wpwindowsphone-1-8-comment-moderation" width="300" height="560" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-347" /></a>The team is excited to announce version 1.8 of WordPress for Windows Phone!

The ability to moderate multiple comments at once is now available right from the comments list.</p>\n<p>Simply tap the moderate icon in the toolbar to access bulk moderation. Tap the checkboxes next to the comments to select them, then tap a moderation option to moderate them all at once.</p>\n<p>But wait, there&#8217;s more! It&#8217;s now possible to filter comments by their status, just open the menu and select one of the filters.</p>\n<p>Here are other improvements and bugs fixed in version 1.8:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multi-sites and subdirectory installations can now be added to the app without hassle, as long as the app can access the RSD endpoint of your site.</li>\n<li>Bug fix: the loading indicator no longer occasionally stays on the screen when the back button is pressed.</li>\n<li>A bunch of minor issues related to the connectivity layer were fixed in this release.</li>\n</ul>\n<a href="http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2012/12/07/version-1-8/#gallery-314-1-slideshow">Click to view slideshow.</a>\n<h3>Contributors</h3>\n<p>The following contributors have worked on this release of WordPress for Windows Phone: Â <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/profile/aerych">aerych</a>,Â <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/profile/daniloercoli">daniloercoli</a>.</p>\n<p>Would you like to get in on the fun?

It also resolves many of the outstanding issues and quirks that you have mentioned on theÂ <a href="http://windowsphone.forums.wordpress.org/">forums</a>Â and onÂ <a href="http://twitter.com/wpwindowsphone">Twitter</a>.Â Read on to find out more.</p>\n<h3>New Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Local Drafts<br />\n</strong>Nothingâs worse than working on a great post only to have it disappear because of a bad internet connection. That&#8217;s why we made it possible to save a new post or page as a Local Draft on your device.</li>\n<li><strong>Multimedia Management improvements</strong><br />\nAdding photos to your blog posts is now easier than ever. You can choose to upload straight from the camera or from the photo library on your device. You can also now set the positioning (i.e: display at the top or bottom of your post) by tapping the picture on the Edit screen.</li>\n<li><strong>Post Format Support<br />\n</strong>At the bottom of the Edit screen, youâll now see an option for setting the post format for your posts. The app will check with your blog to get a list of post formats that your theme supports.</li>\n<li><strong>Windows Phone 8 compatibility</strong><br />\nWhile this release focuses mainly on bugs and performance enhancements, it also includes some updates to help Windows Phone users take advantage of the latest addition from Microsoft: Windows Phone 8!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Version 1.7 also includes numerous other bug fixes and improvements not listed here.

According to a <a href="http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Dec/242">security bulletin published</a> by Jason Donenfeld on Seclist.org, after installing the plugin from the WordPress plugin repository through the backend of WordPress, there are two avenues of attack left open.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n1) Directory listings were enabled on the cache directory, which means anyone could easily recursively download all the database cache keys,<br />\nand extract ones containing sensitive information, such as password hashes. A simple google search of &#8220;inurl:wp-content/plugins/w3tc/dbcache&#8221; and maybe some other magic reveals this wasn&#8217;t just an issue for me. As W3 Total Cache already futzes with the .htaccess file, I see no reason for it not to add &#8220;Options -Indexes&#8221; to it upon installation. I haven&#8217;t read any W3 documentation, so it&#8217;s possible this is a known and documented misconfiguration, but maybe not.</p>\n<p>2) Even with directory listings off, cache files are by default publicly downloadable, and the key values / file names of the database cache items are easily predictable. Again, it seems odd that &#8220;deny from all&#8221; isn&#8217;t added to the .htaccess file. Maybe it&#8217;s documented somewhere that you should secure your directories, or maybe it isn&#8217;t; I&#8217;m not sure.</p></blockquote>\n<p>However, <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/w3-total-cache-critical-vulnerability-disclosed-1">within the plugin&#8217;s support forums</a> on WordPress.org, Otto suggested that until a fix is released, to check and see if you&#8217;re using &#8220;Disk: Basic&#8221; or &#8220;Disk: Enhanced&#8221; for database caching. If so, disable database caching and clear out those caches. </p>\n<div class="yarpp-related-rss">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/wp-super-cache-1-0-released" rel="bookmark" title="WP Super Cache 1.0 Released">WP Super Cache 1.0 Released</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/share-your-wordpress-security-nightmare" rel="bookmark" title="Share Your WordPress Security Nightmare">Share Your WordPress Security Nightmare</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/top-5-wordpress-security-tips-you-most-likely-dont-follow" rel="bookmark" title="Top 5 WordPress Security Tips You Most Likely Don&#8217;t Follow">Top 5 WordPress Security Tips You Most Likely Don&#8217;t Follow</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/dJ3PpaC8SJk" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 28 Dec 2012 19:54:52 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"WPTavern: bbPress Publishes 2012 Year In Review";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=6746";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:99:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/oTY3wyCumUQ/bbpress-publishes-2012-year-in-review";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1818:"<p><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/bbpresslogo.png" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/bbpresslogo.png" alt="bbpress.org Logo" width="205" height="70" class="alignright size-full wp-image-5463" /></a>John James Jacoby has published the <a href="http://bbpress.org/blog/2012/12/year-in-review/">2012 year in review post</a> for bbPress.

Among some of the cool stuff added to bbPress during 2012 are <em>retina support, theme compatibility, multiple user roles, private/hidden forums, BuddyPress integration, Akismet integration, and improved multisite support.</em> Although it&#8217;s taken awhile, it looks like the community is really starting to rally behind the project again. </p>\n<p>For those of you that are using the plugin version of bbPress, what are your thoughts on the new project so far? </p>\n<div class="yarpp-related-rss">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/the-future-of-bbpress-lies-within-wordpress" rel="bookmark" title="The Future Of bbPress Lies Within WordPress">The Future Of bbPress Lies Within WordPress</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/new-home-for-bbpress-development-chatter" rel="bookmark" title="New Home For bbPress Development Chatter">New Home For bbPress Development Chatter</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.wptavern.com/buddypress-and-bbpress-are-getting-a-divorce" rel="bookmark" title="BuddyPress And bbPress Are Getting A Divorce">BuddyPress And bbPress Are Getting A Divorce</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/oTY3wyCumUQ" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 28 Dec 2012 19:35:12 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:63:"WordPress.tv: Joel R.

This makes perfect sense right now, and really goes a long way towards more tightly integrating the WordPress/bbPress ecosystems together.</p>\n<h4>bbPress Releases</h4>\n<p>bbPress saw the release of 2.1 and 2.2 this year, both major versions that included some pretty nifty and progressive features, such as: retina support, theme compatibility, multiple user roles, private/hidden forums, BuddyPress integration, Akismet integration, and improved multisite support.</p>\n<p>bbPress recently welcomed Jennifer M.

They were a fun experiment, but largely confusing to users and a moderation nightmare for site staffers. BuddyPress.org also experienced another redesign, taking much inspiration from bbPress.org and shifting focus away from evangelizing and towards supporting and showcasing what a nicely integrated BuddyPress installation can be.</p>\n<h4>BuddyPress Releases</h4>\n<p>BuddyPress saw both 1.5 and 1.6, with focus on cleaning up the codebase, gently migrating off of bbPress 1.1 for group forums, activity stream administration, performance improvements, and better single and multisite switching support. We also had our very first BuddyCamp in Vancouver, which was an amazing event thanks to Matt, the event organizers, sponsors, and all-of-the-other awesome contributors.</p>\n<p>In 2012, we added our 4th core committer, Raymond Hoh. Ray has been a prolific contributor since the early days, and recently stepped up his game where him not having commit access was slowing him down.

who has developed against Facebook&#8217;s API knows that the only constant is change &#8211; Facebook is an ever-evolving platform. In <a href="https://alexking.org/blog/2012/12/21/social-2-7">Social</a> we&#8217;ve made changes a few different times to the way we broadcast links.</p>\n<p>Our original posting approach was working fine, but as Facebook started rolling out their &#8220;Share&#8221; feature, it wasn&#8217;t available on links being published by Social. We poked around and found that if we used a different endpoint then the Share feature would be available for these broadcasts. So we made the change.</p>\n<p>Recently another problem popped up. The Facebook broadcasts were no longer showing up with the post&#8217;s featured image. Turns out that feature was removed from the endpoint we were using. Fortunately, the original endpoint we were using (which does allow us to send an image with the link) started supporting the Share feature, so we&#8217;ve switched back to that one in Social 2.7.</p>\n<p>For posts that have no image, Facebook falls back on it&#8217;s Open Graph protocol. If you want to tell Facebook what image to use with your broadcasts, you can do so by installing one of a number of Facebook Open Graph plugins.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 21 Dec 2012 21:57:43 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Alex";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"Alex King: Social 2.7";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://alexking.org/?p=15412";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"http://alexking.org/blog/2012/12/21/social-2-7";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1221:"<p>Just in time for the holidays I am very pleased to report we have a new version of <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/social/">Social</a> for you (compliments of our good friends at <a href="http://mailchimp.com">MailChimp</a> and my team at <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com">Crowd Favorite</a>).</p>\n<p>This release as a few changes of note:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Points to a new Social proxy URL.

Time to work on those ill-fated New Year&#8217;s resolutions. Time to relax and reflect on the past year and lessons learned.</p>\n<p>Here at Akismet, we proudly work year round to protect millions of sites from comment spam. To date, in fact, we have eliminated over <strong>65 billion</strong> (yes, with a &#8216;b&#8217;) spam comments, and we saw many interesting &#8212; and nasty &#8212; things in 2012. Make no mistake about it &#8212; spam levels are certainly on the rise.</p>\n<p>Akismet saved the web from over <strong>25 billionÂ </strong>pieces of spam content this past year alone (and December is not over yet!). Toward the end of the year, specifically, we began seeing alarming and heightened levels of spam. Our daily totals &#8212; starting in early December &#8212; began topping <strong>120 million</strong> spam comments <strong>per day</strong>, a trend that appears to be continuing into the new year. To add some perspective, these numbers are roughly double what we were seeing in previous months. We also toppedÂ the <strong>3 billion</strong>Â spam mark in November:</p>\n<p><a href="http://akismet.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/2012-akismet-spam.png"><img alt="Akismet Spam Totals By Month, 2012" src="http://akismet.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/2012-akismet-spam.png?w=550" /></a></p>\n<p><em><small>The chart above contains both current (C) and projected (P) December figures.</small></em></p>\n<p>More troubling in terms of trends, there has been an unfortunate increase in compromised sites, wikis, and forums. We come across these after a hacker takes over a site, sets up their payload, and proceeds to spam a great number of sites with their malicious links. It is clear that spammers are increasingly willing to use illegal methods, such as hacking and exploiting these vulnerable websites. We have even seen these tactics used to advertise otherwise-reputable and well-known websites, a trend that suggests some marketing firms are outsourcing work to black-hat spammers.</p>\n<p>Further noticeable increases in spam include elevated traffic from China, as well as the promotion of Chinese knockoff fashion sites. If you happen to regularly check your spam queue, we&#8217;re sure that you&#8217;ve seen at least one offer to purchase discount Christian Louboutin shoes or &#8220;authentic&#8221; Michael Kors purses. Also steadily on the rise has been spam content promoting TV streaming, payday loans, and &#8220;Get rich by working from home!&#8221; sites and programs. Sure, we have all seen this garbage before, but its recent increase is something to still keep in mind. Here are some example sites, all of which were created on free blog hosts:</p>\n\n<a href="http://blog.akismet.com/2012/12/21/a-spammy-year-in-review/tv-streaming-spam-example/" title="TV Streaming Spam"><img /></a>\n<a href="http://blog.akismet.com/2012/12/21/a-spammy-year-in-review/knockoff-spam-example/" title="Knockoff Spam"><img /></a>\n<a href="http://blog.akismet.com/2012/12/21/a-spammy-year-in-review/oakley-knockoff-spam-example/" title="Knockoff Spam"><img /></a>\n<a href="http://blog.akismet.com/2012/12/21/a-spammy-year-in-review/payday-loan-spam-example/" title="Payday Loan Spam"><img /></a>\n<a href="http://blog.akismet.com/2012/12/21/a-spammy-year-in-review/tv-streaming-spam-example3/" title="TV Streaming Spam"><img /></a>\n<a href="http://blog.akismet.com/2012/12/21/a-spammy-year-in-review/tv-streaming-spam-example2/" title="TV Streaming Spam"><img /></a>\n\n<p>Spammers have also taken a liking to the abuse of reputable affiliate and referral programs.Their goal is simple: set up a free blog or site (example shown below), publish oodles of product listings including specific affiliate URLs, and spam the rest of the internet. You may notice that many of these spammers plant their payloads on free site hosts. Luckily, on <a title="WordPress.com" href="http://wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a>, Akismet is actively working to combat the creation of these spam sites. We would love to see such integration on other hosts.</p>\n<p><a href="http://akismet.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/affiliate-program-spam-example.png"><img alt="Affiliate Spammer" src="http://akismet.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/affiliate-program-spam-example.png?w=550" /></a></p>\n<p><em><small>A spammer abusing Amazon&#8217;s affiliate program. A prominent form of spam in 2012.</small></em></p>\n<p>Recent streams of human-generated spam are also worth mentioning. These campaigns tend to focus on more difficult targets, such as forums, third-party commenting platforms, and social networks. Such spam can be more difficult to systematically neutralize, which is why Akismet continues to develop and employ refined tactics against it.</p>\n<p>Rest assured, we are always hard at work to make sure that any global increase in spam does not mean an unfortunate rise in unwanted comments getting through to your posts or moderation queues. Because we know that you have far more important things to do than sift through trash.</p>\n<p>As always, our resolution for the new year is to continue making Akismet better, faster, and more accurate. As spam evolves, so will Akismet. We sincerely thank each and every one of our users for trusting us to defend their sites against the web&#8217;s underbelly.</p>\n<p>Happy Holidays to you and yours,<br />\nTeam Akismet</p>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/akismet.wordpress.com/795/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/akismet.wordpress.com/795/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=blog.akismet.com&blog=116920&post=795&subd=akismet&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 21 Dec 2012 15:03:02 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7:"Anthony";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress Plugin Releases for 12/21";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=12396";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~3/Am8-VhmM74U/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1197:"<h3>New plugins</h3>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/initial-letter/"><strong>Initial Letter</strong></a> adds style options so you can change the size, color, and font of the first letter of each paragraph.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jetpack-subscriptions-shortcode/"><strong>Jetpack Subscriptions shortcode</strong></a> extends the <a href="http://jetpack.me">Jetpack</a> plugin and allows you to add a Subscription form anywhere inside your posts.</p>\n<h3>Updated plugins</h3>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/facebook/"><strong>Facebook</strong></a> makes your site deeply social by integrating functionality from Facebook.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/keyring/"><strong>Keyring</strong></a> provides a very hookable, completely customizable framework for connecting your WordPress site to an external service.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/slingpic/"><strong>Slingpic</strong></a> is an image sharing tool that allows your users to share images from your site quickly and easily.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~4/Am8-VhmM74U" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 21 Dec 2012 14:00:24 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"James";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"WP Windows Phone 7: Version 1.8.1 Available and Whatâs Next";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/?p=352";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2012/12/21/version-1-8-1/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1298:"<p>Version 1.8.1 of the WordPress for Windows Phone app just became available on the Store.

Cities routinely survive even nuclear bombs. And &#8220;cities are the crucible of civilization.&#8221; They are the major source of innovation and wealth creation. Currently they are growing exponentially. &#8220;Every week from now until 2050, one million new people are being added to our cities.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>That&#8217;s from the intro to <a href="http://longnow.org/seminars/02011/jul/25/why-cities-keep-growing-corporations-always-die-and-life-gets-faster/">Geoffrey West&#8217;s Long Now seminar &#8220;Why Cities Keep on Growing, Corporations Always Die, and Life Gets Faster&#8221;</a>.</p>\n<p>Kevin Kelly summarized it in this way:</p>\n<div class="blockquote">\n<blockquote>All organisms (and companies) have share many universal laws of growth. Creatures age in the same way, whether they are small animals, large mammals, starfish, bacteria, and even cells. They share similar metabolic rates. Similar distributions. All ecosystems (and cities) also share universal laws. They evolve and scale in a similar fashion among themselves â whether they are forests, meadows, coral reefs, or grasslands, or villages.</p>\n<p>Geoff West from the Santa Fe Institute has piles of data to prove these universal and predictive laws of life. For instance, organisms scale in a 3/4 law. For every doubling in size, they increase in other factors by less than one, or .75. The bigger the organism, the slower it goes. Both elephants and mice have the same number of heartbeats per lifespan, but he elephant beats slower.</p>\n<p>Ecosystems and cities, on the other hand, scale by greater than one, or 1.15. Every year cities increase in wealth, crime, traffic, patents, pollution, disease, infrastructure, and per capita by 15%. The bigger the city, the faster it goes.</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>Geoff&#8217;s talk is worth a listen, especially as you consider how companies grow and evolve over timespans measured in decades, not years or rounds of funding.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 19 Dec 2012 14:46:11 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:9:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Sun, 13 Jan 2013 04:38:36 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:14:"content-length";s:6:"124369";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Sun, 13 Jan 2013 04:15:14 GMT";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT luv 138";s:13:"accept-ranges";s:5:"bytes";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20121222040105";}', 'no');

And I''m more than happy to have graduated on time despite more than a few hitches in my trip.\r\n\r\nFor two consecutive days I braved the heat of graduation ceremonies in aÂ <i>barong tagalog</i>. It was, after all, for these ceremonies that I shared with my fellow (ex-?)students that I swallowed the unfair mismanagement of our undergraduate research project. But everyday I wake up after being judged to know, ummmm, "BS Computer Science", I am always reminded that the ceremonies didn''t matter and were but mere formalities. It was the gradual steps we took towards graduation which (hopefully) made us deserving of what they conferred on us.\r\n\r\nI almost found myself crying after receiving my diploma that I found it difficult to smile for the photographs. Finally, after four years, I get to clean my room and my computer of all the accumulated "proofs of passing" I''ve been saving as a contingency plan, in case some disputes about my grades arise in the near future. Even right now, it is with great awe that I behold my passing grades in Discrete Math and Physics 72. Well, you never know.\r\n\r\nAnd because, thank thesis, it''s been over two months since I last posted here, I''m still too lazy to give anything coherent; I''m still catching up on missed sleep, missed games, and missed personal projects. So we eat up the rest of the space with my tips on how to make living on this rock we call the Earth a worthwhile endeavor.\r\n\r\n<strong>Read books.</strong>Â Seriously. And I don''t just mean that you meticulously read ahead of this week''s lecture at school. I mean to say that you go out of your way and find books that will take you to worlds undiscovered and will bring you thoughts to ponder. The human civilization may be young compared to some alien culture lurking just behind the neighboring galaxies but we have already accumulated quite a trove of wisdom and almost all of them are recorded in books.\r\n\r\nAlmost.\r\n\r\n<strong>Have real-life adventures.</strong>Â Travel when and where you can. Take unknown paths. Do things without always knowing how they''ll turn out. This is how you''ll accumulate wisdom for yourself. You''ll surely be missing out a lot if you don''t read books but never ever forget that your life is one huge book-in-the-works as well and it will be such a shame to look back one day, realizing that your book is empty or well-written but unread.\r\n\r\n<strong>Make mistakes.</strong>Â Waste your time. You''ll thank yourself for it. If that book you are writing isn''t full of erasures you are most probably not trying out a lot of things. Don''t follow tried-and-tested recipes. That is not how you''ll learn.\r\n\r\n<strong>Be aware of what you don''t know.</strong>Â And I assure you this will save your skin. And the skin of the people tossed with you in this adventure. Being aware of what you don''t know will help you make sense of your mistakes. You will be better prepared next time. Hallelujah to the things we don''t know.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly,\r\n\r\n<strong>Do not listen to every advice thrown your way.</strong>Â I have come to accept that life, unlike research, does not require a theoretical framework for you to move forward. All you need is some nerve and, believe you me, you will be surprised how often this Universe/Fate/Destiny/Karma/God rewards raw nerve. Not always, but more often than what other people will have you believe. It is alright to just make things up as you go. No one will take it against you.', 'For What It''s Worth', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '19-revision-3', '', '', '2012-12-22 08:34:38', '2012-12-22 08:34:38', '', 19, 'http://localhost/skytreader.net/19-revision-3/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

I brought some mosquito repellent with me, only to find out that I should''ve feared the ants as well. The only way I could''ve cleaned myself (even partially) entailed going through the cold caress of mountain water. This is adventure indeed, the kind catterpillars sadly forget as they become butterflies.\r\n\r\nMy muscles are aching as I type like I worked out for a whole month straight without even a few seconds of water break anywhere in between. But the ache reminds me of a good two nights and two days spent in the cradle of Maria Makiling. Clearly, this is the welcome kind of muscle ache, one that is the sign not of deteriorating health but of a life lived in two-days'' worth of adventure. I''m both glad and sad that they''d be gone in a few days. How I''d miss this feeling and the kind of joy the experience brought me. I feel that I''ve lived life, for two nights and two days, as the experience took my breath away.\r\n\r\nBefore I delve into the fun of reliving the adventure allow me first to wish my left shoe a very solemn "Rest In Peace". You have been loyal to me for the past two years or so my dear friend, going through mud and shine, opening your mouth that protects the fingertips of my left foot eventually but not making a single sound of complaint. Your twin, right shoe, will have to rest as well, now that you are gone. I regret that he won''t be able to do it in the house though, as we are pretty crowded already.\r\n\r\nMy left shoe died an honorable death, in the midst of adventure, as I spent the good part of last weekend jumping through rocks and grabbing various plants for dear life, double checking in a hurried fashion beforehand that it is without thorns and that it is not actually some camouflaging fauna. It died last Saturday but I had to abuse it further by using it again for the same purposes the next day after last Saturday which is last Sunday. My vocal chords nearly died as well, as I screamed cheers and whoa''s in flow with my group''s collective effervescence.\r\n\r\nAnd as I know that general allusions to the experience will do the adventure no justice, allow me to compress about two days'' worth of story in a single web page, as I try to set the record for the longest blog post ever. Right. Let the stories start.\r\n\r\n<b>Table of Contents</b>\r\n<a href="#day1">Laying Down Ground</a>Â |Â <a href="#day2">The Trek</a>Â |Â <a href="#day3">Running Again, Some Swimming, and Goodbye Finally</a>\r\n\r\n<a id="day1" name="day1"></a>\r\n\r\nLaying Down Ground\r\nFriday, February 5, 2010, Deep Evening\r\n\r\nTired and exhausted from last night''s academic cramming as well as from the day that passed, I stepped off the bus and was readily greeted by Orion. Arr hunter, I say. Thanks for the greeting as I am here not to choose the events that will happen but to let the adventure choose me. Be my guide.\r\n\r\nFor the good part of the night we tried to make the provided tents as cozy as possible. Evidently, a man''s idea of "cozy" is way different from a woman''s. A tent is capable of holding six people but seven of us had to share, plus a few battalion of ants. I brought some mosquito repellent but I''m totally unprepared for these warriors, biting us violently for entering the critical zone of their territory. And we had our luggage with us too, taking up a generous part of our already-cramped tent. I remember being told once that pretty men travel light. If that is true, then Maria Makiling won''t be dating any of us by default.\r\n\r\nWe were briefed of what awaits us. I didn''t hear anything save for the word "exciting". After about an hour of planning we embark for slumber land and I felt the rough contours of the earth against my back.

This is the first time we''ll be actually cooking and, incidentally, my stomach''s been lucky enough to have a choice between two culinary sets so that if something goes wrong here, I always have the other group for back-up. It''s a long and complicated story of how come there were two groups but in any case, the two groups merged into one later on, forming what can be considered as our main class, plus a few additions.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, pictures...\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Rappel Instructors" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4343350242/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Rappel Instructors" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4040/4343350242_589eba91f6_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>As you see, it was still pretty dark when we started cooking that I cannot rely on natural lighting and I had to resort to flash.

Being one of the two group leaders, AJ spent sometime going around the tents of our group, retrieving their consciousness from slumber. A few minutes into the activity and we were entertained by someone''s semi-consciousness and made-up terms courtesy of the spirit that is alcohol:Â <i>"Lutuin na yang mga AJ na yan!"</i>Â (Cook those AJ''s now!), and,Â <i>"Lagyan ng isang metrong wetness yung shroup"</i>Â (Add a meter of wetness to the shroup), she''s been saying (yes she''s a she). We laughed our heads off from that episode for about a couple of hours, until the person concerned regained full control of her consciousness and...you should''ve seen her face.\r\n\r\nI spent two hours doing nothing but walking around and eating breakfast, breathing fresh mountain air. It feels and sounds so bummer to relate that I ate instant noodles on a moment as fresh as that. Instant noodles is the only junk food that remains in my system after all. I''ve kicked my addiction to soft drinks and cheesy potato chips but not to instant noodles. Note, however, that I suggested, before Saturday''s adventure, that we hunt for snakes along the trail so that we''ll have something to cook in camp--a suggestion that was met with yeah-right faces from my groupmates.\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Breakfast at Camp" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4347544313/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Breakfast at Camp" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2777/4347544313_ee9d376f13_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>Sunday morning breakfast at camp.</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSunday''s most anticipated activity is map navigation, an activity very similar to trekking sans the almost-vertical slopes, packed lunch, and instructor guides but with a lot of competition, a lot of tasks and a single compass. I cannot decide what is more memorable between the trek and map nav. They''ll most probably tie. The trek is memorable because of the ooh''s and wow''s generated by nature''s beauty; map nav, on the other hand, is memorable due to all the adrenaline and willpower involved. We were so competitive in map nav that I really wasn''t able to take any pictures.\r\n\r\nWe were misguided and so we were lost for about a good half an hour. Nonetheless, we returned first in camp and you can only imagine with what euphoria did we tread around the still-empty tents, willpower being replaced by effervescence and cheers. Unfortunately, we didn''t win Best in Navigation because start times are not the same for all groups and so there are some chronological translation involved.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch, some refreshments, and a few hours'' rest, we proceeded to the pool to cross about 100 meters, with an optional break after meter 50. Not the most anticipated activity because swimming isn''t really something you''d learn in a few meetings. At this point, I would like to thank one instructor who gave me some last-moment pointers on how to conquer water. It''s thanks to him I crossed 50 at my first try and almost made it to 100 at the second one. I am most grateful.\r\n\r\nAnd what did our group get after this whole adventure? Aside from bonding moments, we got also got this,\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Best Group" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4348344160/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Best Group" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4045/4348344160_4fe35d4847_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>Best in Navigation went to the group who made their way past all the tasks and points fastest; it does not necessarily mean that they did the tasks best. Best Group, on the other hand, went to the group who did everything best; since they are best in everything, it also means that they have the best time in navigation (it need not be stated since it is already implied). Quod Erat Demonstrandum. That I want to show.</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt''s been fun and I am thankful for this adventure, this opportunity to bond with nature and other people. I didn''t travel light but I guess Maria Makiling still dated me. I saw her beauty and I hope I''ve been the gentleman Nature deserves. In about two days I''ve seen cliffs, walked a forest and drank mountain water--lived all my boyhood dreams, in short. After such an experience, it feels so bummer to say "Damn! I have a Calculus exam this Saturday and a Data Structures exam this Monday".\r\n\r\nI shall not forget, the day I met Maria.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<hr noshade="noshade" />\r\n\r\n<b>Colophon:</b>Â I keep on saying that the adventure lasted forÂ <i>about two days</i>Â when my story is divided into three chapters.

(29, 1, '2012-12-22 08:50:53', '2012-12-22 08:50:53', 'I spent last weekend in the wild, being dirty and sleeping inside cramped messy tents whose temperature fluctuates between cold and scorching hot, depending on what time of the day it is. I brought some mosquito repellent with me, only to find out that I should''ve feared the ants as well. The only way I could''ve cleaned myself (even partially) entailed going through the cold caress of mountain water. This is adventure indeed, the kind catterpillars sadly forget as they become butterflies.\n\nMy muscles are aching as I type like I worked out for a whole month straight without even a few seconds of water break anywhere in between. But the ache reminds me of a good two nights and two days spent in the cradle of Maria Makiling. Clearly, this is the welcome kind of muscle ache, one that is the sign not of deteriorating health but of a life lived in two-days'' worth of adventure. I''m both glad and sad that they''d be gone in a few days. How I''d miss this feeling and the kind of joy the experience brought me. I feel that I''ve lived life, for two nights and two days, as the experience took my breath away.\n\nBefore I delve into the fun of reliving the adventure allow me first to wish my left shoe a very solemn "Rest In Peace". You have been loyal to me for the past two years or so my dear friend, going through mud and shine, opening your mouth that protects the fingertips of my left foot eventually but not making a single sound of complaint. Your twin, right shoe, will have to rest as well, now that you are gone. I regret that he won''t be able to do it in the house though, as we are pretty crowded already.\n\nMy left shoe died an honorable death, in the midst of adventure, as I spent the good part of last weekend jumping through rocks and grabbing various plants for dear life, double checking in a hurried fashion beforehand that it is without thorns and that it is not actually some camouflaging fauna. It died last Saturday but I had to abuse it further by using it again for the same purposes the next day after last Saturday which is last Sunday. My vocal chords nearly died as well, as I screamed cheers and whoa''s in flow with my group''s collective effervescence.\n\nAnd as I know that general allusions to the experience will do the adventure no justice, allow me to compress about two days'' worth of story in a single web page, as I try to set the record for the longest blog post ever. Right. Let the stories start.\n\n<b>Table of Contents</b>\n<a href="http://skytreader.net/journal/meeting-maria#day1">Laying Down Ground</a>Â |Â <a href="http://skytreader.net/journal/meeting-maria#day2">The Trek</a>Â |Â <a href="http://skytreader.net/journal/meeting-maria#day3">Running Again, Some Swimming, and Goodbye Finally</a>\n\n<a id="day1" name="day1"></a>\n\nLaying Down Ground\nFriday, February 5, 2010, Deep Evening\n\nTired and exhausted from last night''s academic cramming as well as from the day that passed, I stepped off the bus and was readily greeted by Orion. Arr hunter, I say. Thanks for the greeting as I am here not to choose the events that will happen but to let the adventure choose me. Be my guide.\n\nFor the good part of the night we tried to make the provided tents as cozy as possible. Evidently, a man''s idea of "cozy" is way different from a woman''s. A tent is capable of holding six people but seven of us had to share, plus a few battalion of ants. I brought some mosquito repellent but I''m totally unprepared for these warriors, biting us violently for entering the critical zone of their territory. And we had our luggage with us too, taking up a generous part of our already-cramped tent. I remember being told once that pretty men travel light. If that is true, then Maria Makiling won''t be dating any of us by default.\n\nWe were briefed of what awaits us. I didn''t hear anything save for the word "exciting". After about an hour of planning we embark for slumber land and I felt the rough contours of the earth against my back.

This is the first time we''ll be actually cooking and, incidentally, my stomach''s been lucky enough to have a choice between two culinary sets so that if something goes wrong here, I always have the other group for back-up. It''s a long and complicated story of how come there were two groups but in any case, the two groups merged into one later on, forming what can be considered as our main class, plus a few additions.\n\nAnd yes, pictures...\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Rappel Instructors" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4343350242/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Rappel Instructors" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4040/4343350242_589eba91f6_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\n\n<div>As you see, it was still pretty dark when we started cooking that I cannot rely on natural lighting and I had to resort to flash.

I was wrong. The trek found me with my shirt glued wet by perspiration on my back. I found myself finally appreciating Gatorade and thanking AJ for lending me a cap. The trail was beautiful, green and overflowing with flora, ripe for some shots. Unfortunately, my hands had been busy looking for firm features to hold on to and breaking the momentum I gain as my feet followed the dictates of the natural laws of inclined planes, too tired to resist. This is where my left shoe died, in service, ever loyal.\n\nThat all said, I still managed to take some pictures while trekking.\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Dyan and Che, with a flower they find pretty" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4346422384/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Dyan and Che, with a flower they find pretty" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4014/4346422384_f989f424ce_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\n\n<div>Dyan and Che, with a flower they find pretty</div>\n&nbsp;\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Don''t faeries bathe in here?" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4346424596/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Don''t faeries bathe in here?" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2613/4346424596_e70800d5b4_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\n\n<div>Don''t faeries bathe in here?</div>\n&nbsp;\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4345683253/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4012/4345683253_cf3dd128e1_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\n\n<div>Taken just before we stopped to eat packed lunch live at the trail.</div>\n&nbsp;\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4346429276/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2767/4346429276_02f68a8958_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\n\n<div>Ging and Baki.

Taken by Dyan.</div>\n&nbsp;\n\nReturning to camp, I found myself slumped dead near the entrance of our tent, not minding the heat, nor the flies buzzing around, nor the ants who seem addicted to my shirtless torso. I know not how many miles we walked nor how high a height we reached. I did not take a bath immediately which was lucky because our group had someone to sprawl on the ground when we were taught how to rescue someone down in a cliff with a possible spine injury.\n\nDarkness bit the skies again and soon we were cooking and eating by flashlight. It''s such a shame we were not able to light a bonfire because all the firewood around can only be found along the trail, and our own legs might just kick ourselves in protest if ever we plan to return there just to gather some firewood.\n\n<a id="day3" name="day3"></a>\n\nRunning Again, Some Swimming, and Goodbye Finally\nSunday, February 7, 2010, Morning to Mid-Afternoon\n\nAJ and me woke up at around 4AM. Being one of the two group leaders, AJ spent sometime going around the tents of our group, retrieving their consciousness from slumber. A few minutes into the activity and we were entertained by someone''s semi-consciousness and made-up terms courtesy of the spirit that is alcohol:Â <i>"Lutuin na yang mga AJ na yan!"</i>Â (Cook those AJ''s now!), and,Â <i>"Lagyan ng isang metrong wetness yung shroup"</i>Â (Add a meter of wetness to the shroup), she''s been saying (yes she''s a she). We laughed our heads off from that episode for about a couple of hours, until the person concerned regained full control of her consciousness and...you should''ve seen her face.\n\nI spent two hours doing nothing but walking around and eating breakfast, breathing fresh mountain air. It feels and sounds so bummer to relate that I ate instant noodles on a moment as fresh as that. Instant noodles is the only junk food that remains in my system after all. I''ve kicked my addiction to soft drinks and cheesy potato chips but not to instant noodles. Note, however, that I suggested, before Saturday''s adventure, that we hunt for snakes along the trail so that we''ll have something to cook in camp--a suggestion that was met with yeah-right faces from my groupmates.\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Breakfast at Camp" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4347544313/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Breakfast at Camp" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2777/4347544313_ee9d376f13_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\n\n<div>Sunday morning breakfast at camp.</div>\n&nbsp;\n\nSunday''s most anticipated activity is map navigation, an activity very similar to trekking sans the almost-vertical slopes, packed lunch, and instructor guides but with a lot of competition, a lot of tasks and a single compass. I cannot decide what is more memorable between the trek and map nav. They''ll most probably tie. The trek is memorable because of the ooh''s and wow''s generated by nature''s beauty; map nav, on the other hand, is memorable due to all the adrenaline and willpower involved. We were so competitive in map nav that I really wasn''t able to take any pictures.\n\nWe were misguided and so we were lost for about a good half an hour.

And also, they are the second cooking group I''ve been talking about.\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4343360322/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2700/4343360322_908a3f103b_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\r\nAnd oh, yes, just to give you an idea, this is where we''ve been sleeping:\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Tents" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4342615167/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Tents" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4051/4342615167_ce310506bf_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\r\nBeing the celestial body lover that I am, I made sure that I know what time will the sun rise and set for the whole time we''ve been there, as part of my preparations. Unfortunately, sunrise and sunset isn''t as pronounced as I expected here. But that is not to say that I did not shoot some scenery.\r\n\r\nSaturday morning sunrise at camp...\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4343353158/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2702/4343353158_c0c5e6e92d_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4343354262/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4010/4343354262_090941d8bf_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4342620127/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2775/4342620127_a5f9aff911_b.jpg" width="461" height="614" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4342621399/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2727/4342621399_621c235d1f_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4342622855/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2688/4342622855_0b21ced4f6_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\r\nSaturday was scheduled for trek, an activity which I thought will have me clicking through shots and feeling the cool mountain breeze. I was wrong. The trek found me with my shirt glued wet by perspiration on my back. I found myself finally appreciating Gatorade and thanking AJ for lending me a cap. The trail was beautiful, green and overflowing with flora, ripe for some shots. Unfortunately, my hands had been busy looking for firm features to hold on to and breaking the momentum I gain as my feet followed the dictates of the natural laws of inclined planes, too tired to resist. This is where my left shoe died, in service, ever loyal.\r\n\r\nThat all said, I still managed to take some pictures while trekking.\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Dyan and Che, with a flower they find pretty" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4346422384/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Dyan and Che, with a flower they find pretty" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4014/4346422384_f989f424ce_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>Dyan and Che, with a flower they find pretty</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Don''t faeries bathe in here?" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4346424596/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Don''t faeries bathe in here?" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2613/4346424596_e70800d5b4_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>Don''t faeries bathe in here?</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4345683253/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4012/4345683253_cf3dd128e1_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>Taken just before we stopped to eat packed lunch live at the trail.</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4346429276/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2767/4346429276_02f68a8958_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>Ging and Baki.

Taken by Dyan.</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nReturning to camp, I found myself slumped dead near the entrance of our tent, not minding the heat, nor the flies buzzing around, nor the ants who seem addicted to my shirtless torso. I know not how many miles we walked nor how high a height we reached. I did not take a bath immediately which was lucky because our group had someone to sprawl on the ground when we were taught how to rescue someone down in a cliff with a possible spine injury.\r\n\r\nDarkness bit the skies again and soon we were cooking and eating by flashlight. It''s such a shame we were not able to light a bonfire because all the firewood around can only be found along the trail, and our own legs might just kick ourselves in protest if ever we plan to return there just to gather some firewood.\r\n\r\n<a id="day3" name="day3"></a>\r\n\r\nRunning Again, Some Swimming, and Goodbye Finally\r\nSunday, February 7, 2010, Morning to Mid-Afternoon\r\n\r\nAJ and me woke up at around 4AM. Being one of the two group leaders, AJ spent sometime going around the tents of our group, retrieving their consciousness from slumber. A few minutes into the activity and we were entertained by someone''s semi-consciousness and made-up terms courtesy of the spirit that is alcohol:Â <i>"Lutuin na yang mga AJ na yan!"</i>Â (Cook those AJ''s now!), and,Â <i>"Lagyan ng isang metrong wetness yung shroup"</i>Â (Add a meter of wetness to the shroup), she''s been saying (yes she''s a she). We laughed our heads off from that episode for about a couple of hours, until the person concerned regained full control of her consciousness and...you should''ve seen her face.\r\n\r\nI spent two hours doing nothing but walking around and eating breakfast, breathing fresh mountain air. It feels and sounds so bummer to relate that I ate instant noodles on a moment as fresh as that. Instant noodles is the only junk food that remains in my system after all. I''ve kicked my addiction to soft drinks and cheesy potato chips but not to instant noodles. Note, however, that I suggested, before Saturday''s adventure, that we hunt for snakes along the trail so that we''ll have something to cook in camp--a suggestion that was met with yeah-right faces from my groupmates.\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Breakfast at Camp" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4347544313/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Breakfast at Camp" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2777/4347544313_ee9d376f13_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>Sunday morning breakfast at camp.</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSunday''s most anticipated activity is map navigation, an activity very similar to trekking sans the almost-vertical slopes, packed lunch, and instructor guides but with a lot of competition, a lot of tasks and a single compass. I cannot decide what is more memorable between the trek and map nav. They''ll most probably tie. The trek is memorable because of the ooh''s and wow''s generated by nature''s beauty; map nav, on the other hand, is memorable due to all the adrenaline and willpower involved. We were so competitive in map nav that I really wasn''t able to take any pictures.\r\n\r\nWe were misguided and so we were lost for about a good half an hour. Nonetheless, we returned first in camp and you can only imagine with what euphoria did we tread around the still-empty tents, willpower being replaced by effervescence and cheers. Unfortunately, we didn''t win Best in Navigation because start times are not the same for all groups and so there are some chronological translation involved.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch, some refreshments, and a few hours'' rest, we proceeded to the pool to cross about 100 meters, with an optional break after meter 50. Not the most anticipated activity because swimming isn''t really something you''d learn in a few meetings. At this point, I would like to thank one instructor who gave me some last-moment pointers on how to conquer water. It''s thanks to him I crossed 50 at my first try and almost made it to 100 at the second one. I am most grateful.\r\n\r\nAnd what did our group get after this whole adventure? Aside from bonding moments, we got also got this,\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Best Group" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4348344160/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Best Group" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4045/4348344160_4fe35d4847_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>Best in Navigation went to the group who made their way past all the tasks and points fastest; it does not necessarily mean that they did the tasks best. Best Group, on the other hand, went to the group who did everything best; since they are best in everything, it also means that they have the best time in navigation (it need not be stated since it is already implied). Quod Erat Demonstrandum. That I want to show.</div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt''s been fun and I am thankful for this adventure, this opportunity to bond with nature and other people. I didn''t travel light but I guess Maria Makiling still dated me. I saw her beauty and I hope I''ve been the gentleman Nature deserves. In about two days I''ve seen cliffs, walked a forest and drank mountain water--lived all my boyhood dreams, in short. After such an experience, it feels so bummer to say "Damn! I have a Calculus exam this Saturday and a Data Structures exam this Monday".\r\n\r\nI shall not forget, the day I met Maria.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<hr noshade="noshade" />\r\n\r\n<b>Colophon:</b>Â I keep on saying that the adventure lasted forÂ <i>about two days</i>Â when my story is divided into three chapters.

(49, 1, '2010-12-19 08:29:01', '2010-12-19 08:29:01', 'So, Lantern Parade again. It wasn''t as funtastic as expected, I''m afraid, nor does it stand in comparison with my previous two. It rained before the parade started. Maybe there''s something with the water that broke down part of the spirit.\r\n\r\nThe Parade went as usual for the early part, with people crowding over this lantern and that. But as it wore the lantern lines broke in segments and it wasn''t very exciting anymore. And there was too much ideology involved. Not that you can wash that entirely away from something so UP. But, again, too much compared to my previous two.\r\n\r\nBut then I over speak. A post about the Lantern Parade is a post of pictures, of course. So here they are.\r\n\r\n<a title="An Early Drizzle" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5271652738/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="An Early Drizzle" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5086/5271652738_9738799c67.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>An early drizzle, which soaked the grounds as well as the AS steps, the effect being that those who opted to watch at the AS steps spent the night standing (or so my sister tells me). Which makes me wonder why...</div>\r\n<a title="Why are they sitting down?" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5270509770/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Why are they sitting down?" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5245/5270509770_7d036868de.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>...are they sitting down, here at the Engineering steps? Sure some of them had monoblocks and other what-have-you''s for dry sitting-down but most of them had none. And they sat down, monoblock or no monoblock.</div>\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5269898743/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5128/5269898743_c0bc4bc634.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\nAnyway, this was CSSP''s lantern/float before it rained. I don''t know what''s up with CSSP this year but they seem to be in a particularly celebratory mood; they even had sportsfests and pageants (a la Miss Eng''g, in my opinion) this year. Whatever the celebration may be, cheers to them.\r\n\r\nSee those crayons? They melted thanks to the rain, so unlike real crayons which melts with fire, not water.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<a title="Pouncing Zebra" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5270538088/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Pouncing Zebra" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5168/5270538088_9ee1c0ec79.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div><b>Aside:</b>Â This zebra is so cute. There were other balloons of this kind there, from SpongeBob to Dora, but I only managed to take the picture of this zebra. I''m not very fine with the lighting for this one but according to my sister, this shot is the cutest. Here are some more shots (whose lighting I like but are not very favored with my sister in terms of the cuteness factor).</div>\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5271447817/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5247/5271447817_2f5eab0d1b.jpg" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5271440689/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5168/5271440689_4dd35807d6.jpg" /></a>\r\n\r\nAn early show stealer is our very own Pep Squad. I can''t do their awesomeness justice just by telling you what. And no picture, even one worth a million words, can tell you what poetry their motion wrote. So here''s a video instead.\r\n\r\n<object width="480" height="385" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/by0MoVwSH38?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="480" height="385" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/by0MoVwSH38?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object>\r\n\r\nAnother early show stealer is Architecture, with blocky costumes of architectural masterpieces.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5269903761/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5001/5269903761_cea393ebfb.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>This girl needs an award for the mere effort of standing through the whole length of the parade, keeping balance (with some help, I''ve been told) in face of road bumps.</div>\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5270514304/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5001/5270514304_b071e1f5dd.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>It''s all white but with detail as fine as that, this, too, deserves mention.</div>\r\nNone of the next handful of lanterns struck me in particular. I think some of them was more driven by ideology than by art.\r\n\r\nEngineering---my college---was a big let down, I''m afraid. It started with a particularly crowd-whoa-drawing contraption which looked like a horse''s skeleton with a rider too small for it at the top. Then the rider pedals the bike and the contraption moves and the crowd is amazed. It was followed by electronic (read: Earth-friendly) jeepneys. And then a long march of Engineering organizations which didn''t display anything much aside from orange shirts courtesy of Meralco and org banners.\r\n\r\nUpon entering UP, our Dean then told us the story behind our College''s Lantern Parade performance. There was a time when no one gave much damn on our lantern. Then she gave the ultimatum that, if our Lantern Parade performance remains lackluster, Eng''g Week* won''t be held next year. And the rest is, as they say, history. I don''t know how true this story is, me being unaffliated, but I think it is time to amend that order to something that will require the orgs to show something worth watching. Just my two cents.\r\n\r\nAnyway, we jump to the show stealers of always, the ever-awesome College of Fine Arts.\r\n\r\nI can''t help but feel that their parade is shorter than usual this year. I didn''t see any of the people I know in Fine Arts. But still, they''re awesome.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5270521654/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5290/5270521654_4c809edb4f.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>It''s not much of a shot on my part but this style of lantern is something I find so nice.</div>\r\n<a title="King Blastoise Waving" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5269917513/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="King Blastoise Waving" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5242/5269917513_38b5bdb528.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>King Blastoise you''re so awesome and you''re waving at me!</div>\r\nI''ll tell you a secret and please make sure that King Blastoise here won''t know ''cause he''s so freaking awesome I wouldn''t want to anger him. Back in those days when I spent the day beeping on my high-tech Tamagochi that is Pokemon in the GameBoy Color, I''m not really a very huge Blastoise (or, for that matter, water-type) fan. I''m more the fire type kind of trainer. When Oak/Elm asks me to choose, I always chose Charmander/Cyndaquil which eventually evolves to Charizard/Typhloshion. And then my rival will choose the water-type, Squirtle/Totodile, which grows to Blastoise/Feraligatr. And you know what? I always beat my rival despite the type advantage. I always hard-boiled Squirtle/Wartortle/Blastoise in his shell. Even if he beats me, I''d turn the GameBoy off without saving so that my loss is technically non-existent. Then I''d turn it back on and train some more before having another go at cooking some hard-boiled pokemon.

And then my rival will choose the water-type, Squirtle/Totodile, which grows to Blastoise/Feraligatr. And you know what? I always beat my rival despite the type advantage. I always hard-boiled Squirtle/Wartortle/Blastoise in his shell. Even if he beats me, I''d turn the GameBoy off without saving so that my loss is technically non-existent. Then I''d turn it back on and train some more before having another go at cooking some hard-boiled pokemon. Now you know why I wouldn''t like King Blastoise to know.\n\n<a title="Gyarados Cometh!" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5270528474/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Gyarados Cometh!" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5161/5270528474_e6bd85cc68.jpg" /></a>\n<div>You didn''t tell King Blastoise?

It rained before the parade started. Maybe there''s something with the water that broke down part of the spirit.\r\n\r\nThe Parade went as usual for the early part, with people crowding over this lantern and that. But as it wore the lantern lines broke in segments and it wasn''t very exciting anymore. And there was too much ideology involved. Not that you can wash that entirely away from something so UP. But, again, too much compared to my previous two.\r\n\r\nBut then I over speak. A post about the Lantern Parade is a post of pictures, of course. So here they are.\r\n\r\n<a title="An Early Drizzle" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5271652738/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="An Early Drizzle" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5086/5271652738_9738799c67.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>An early drizzle, which soaked the grounds as well as the AS steps, the effect being that those who opted to watch at the AS steps spent the night standing (or so my sister tells me).

I don''t know what''s up with CSSP this year but they seem to be in a particularly celebratory mood; they even had sportsfests and pageants (a la Miss Eng''g, in my opinion) this year. Whatever the celebration may be, cheers to them.\r\n\r\nSee those crayons?

I think some of them was more driven by ideology than by art.\r\n\r\nEngineering---my college---was a big let down, I''m afraid. It started with a particularly crowd-whoa-drawing contraption which looked like a horse''s skeleton with a rider too small for it at the top. Then the rider pedals the bike and the contraption moves and the crowd is amazed. It was followed by electronic (read: Earth-friendly) jeepneys. And then a long march of Engineering organizations which didn''t display anything much aside from orange shirts courtesy of Meralco and org banners.\r\n\r\nUpon entering UP, our Dean then told us the story behind our College''s Lantern Parade performance. There was a time when no one gave much damn on our lantern. Then she gave the ultimatum that, if our Lantern Parade performance remains lackluster, Eng''g Week* won''t be held next year. And the rest is, as they say, history. I don''t know how true this story is, me being unaffliated, but I think it is time to amend that order to something that will require the orgs to show something worth watching. Just my two cents.\r\n\r\nAnyway, we jump to the show stealers of always, the ever-awesome College of Fine Arts.\r\n\r\nI can''t help but feel that their parade is shorter than usual this year. I didn''t see any of the people I know in Fine Arts. But still, they''re awesome.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5270521654/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5290/5270521654_4c809edb4f.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>It''s not much of a shot on my part but this style of lantern is something I find so nice.</div>\r\n<a title="King Blastoise Waving" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5269917513/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="King Blastoise Waving" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5242/5269917513_38b5bdb528.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>King Blastoise you''re so awesome and you''re waving at me!</div>\r\nI''ll tell you a secret and please make sure that King Blastoise here won''t know ''cause he''s so freaking awesome I wouldn''t want to anger him.

And it was starting to get dark. Perfect for pictures like these...\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Melchor Hall, in Lights" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526233267/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Melchor Hall, in Lights" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7141/6526233267_1e8477b2a9.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\r\n<a title="Lighted Street" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526256373/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Lighted Street" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7151/6526256373_e05b77735f.jpg" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a title="Night Settling" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526278629/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Night Settling" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7028/6526278629_b3ced09f39.jpg" /></a>\r\n\r\nAt this point, I learned/realized a few things in photography.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>You really can''t do much if a scene''s lighting is poor to begin with. Not unless you have your own lighting equipment. But (a) I don''t have that and (b) that looks too out-of-place, space-taking, and inconsiderate for an event like the Lantern Parade.</li>\r\n	<li>Unlike a point-and-shoot''s flash, which fires the lights straight at your subject, an SLR fires flash upwards, assuming there is a ceiling to bounce the light downwards, diffused. This results to a better effect/less glare. There obviously isn''t a ceiling equivalent inÂ <i>outdoors</i>, Lanter Parade set-up. I had to use my hands to direct the flash to my subjects (hood it over the flash like a "ceiling" which will quickly catch the lights and bounce it towards your subject). Thank goodness I realized this quickly.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo, as it was getting dark at this point, it became harder to get decent shots. Lighting was no longer on my side as I was already relying on flash. Otherwise, it''d be too dark or too orange depending on where I decide to shoot.\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Wall-E" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526288615/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Wall-E" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7169/6526288615_149dd71673.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\r\n<a title="The DCS contingent" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526300709/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="The DCS contingent" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7142/6526300709_5753471da0.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>Above pictured is Eng''g''s Wall-E, one of our lanterns, and the DCS/Cursor contingent of the Parade. Like last year, Eng''g scored with a particularly awesomazing lantern followed by aâwait for itâ<i><b>boring</b></i>Â march of Eng''g orgs and banners. My sister, who majors in Broadcast Communication, likens it toÂ <i>dead air</i>Â i.e., awkward and should-be-avoided pauses in radio productions. Unlike the last three years though, they, at least, weren''t wearing orange. Plus points for the fashion factor!</div>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Belly Dancers 1" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526312523/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Belly Dancers 1" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7165/6526312523_3940c75595.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\r\n<a title="Belly Dancers 2" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526328455/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Belly Dancers 2" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7002/6526328455_0f3c95ee95.jpg" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a title="The Fire" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526335201/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="The Fire" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7016/6526335201_9315e7c980.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>I took this shot from one of the torches of the Beta Sigma frat men. Their first number was the human chain/snake which I believe is part of their initiation rights. Even if it is my second time seeing this, it was still kind of chilling especially with their chant. I heard someone (was he from Î²Ï?) call their second partÂ <i>kata</i>Â which is the Karate equivalent of Taekwondo''sÂ <i>poomsae</i>Â or forms. While their formation and synchronicity might look watch-worthy, it didn''t really catch my attention (maybe ''cause I''ve seen better during my TKD days). So, my eyes were wandering off to better photo-ops, their torch flames in particular. It, however, amuses me that Beta Sigma has their own blend of martial arts.</div>\r\nA few more lanterns and it was finally the turn of my most anticipated college ever.

And it was starting to get dark. Perfect for pictures like these...\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Melchor Hall, in Lights" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526233267/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Melchor Hall, in Lights" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7141/6526233267_1e8477b2a9.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a>\n\n<a title="Lighted Street" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526256373/" target="_blank"><img alt="Lighted Street" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7151/6526256373_e05b77735f.jpg" /></a>\n\n<a title="Night Settling" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526278629/" target="_blank"><img alt="Night Settling" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7028/6526278629_b3ced09f39.jpg" /></a></p>\nAt this point, I learned/realized a few things in photography.\n<ul>\n	<li>You really can''t do much if a scene''s lighting is poor to begin with. Not unless you have your own lighting equipment. But (a) I don''t have that and (b) that looks too out-of-place, space-taking, and inconsiderate for an event like the Lantern Parade.</li>\n	<li>Unlike a point-and-shoot''s flash, which fires the lights straight at your subject, an SLR fires flash upwards, assuming there is a ceiling to bounce the light downwards, diffused. This results to a better effect/less glare. There obviously isn''t a ceiling equivalent inÂ <i>outdoors</i>, Lanter Parade set-up. I had to use my hands to direct the flash to my subjects (hood it over the flash like a "ceiling" which will quickly catch the lights and bounce it towards your subject). Thank goodness I realized this quickly.</li>\n</ul>\nSo, as it was getting dark at this point, it became harder to get decent shots. Lighting was no longer on my side as I was already relying on flash. Otherwise, it''d be too dark or too orange depending on where I decide to shoot.\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Wall-E" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526288615/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Wall-E" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7169/6526288615_149dd71673.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a>\n\n<a title="The DCS contingent" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526300709/" target="_blank"><img alt="The DCS contingent" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7142/6526300709_5753471da0.jpg" /></a></p>\n\n<div>Above pictured is Eng''g''s Wall-E, one of our lanterns, and the DCS/Cursor contingent of the Parade. Like last year, Eng''g scored with a particularly awesomazing lantern followed by aâwait for itâ<i><b>boring</b></i>Â march of Eng''g orgs and banners. My sister, who majors in Broadcast Communication, likens it toÂ <i>dead air</i>Â i.e., awkward and should-be-avoided pauses in radio productions. Unlike the last three years though, they, at least, weren''t wearing orange. Plus points for the fashion factor!</div>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Belly Dancers 1" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526312523/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Belly Dancers 1" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7165/6526312523_3940c75595.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a>\n\n<a title="Belly Dancers 2" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526328455/" target="_blank"><img alt="Belly Dancers 2" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7002/6526328455_0f3c95ee95.jpg" /></a>\n\n<a title="The Fire" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526335201/" target="_blank"><img alt="The Fire" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7016/6526335201_9315e7c980.jpg" /></a></p>\n\n<div>I took this shot from one of the torches of the Beta Sigma frat men. Their first number was the human chain/snake which I believe is part of their initiation rights. Even if it is my second time seeing this, it was still kind of chilling especially with their chant. I heard someone (was he from Î²Ï?) call their second partÂ <i>kata</i>Â which is the Karate equivalent of Taekwondo''sÂ <i>poomsae</i>Â or forms. While their formation and synchronicity might look watch-worthy, it didn''t really catch my attention (maybe ''cause I''ve seen better during my TKD days). So, my eyes were wandering off to better photo-ops, their torch flames in particular. It, however, amuses me that Beta Sigma has their own blend of martial arts.</div>\nA few more lanterns and it was finally the turn of my most anticipated college ever.

Not unless you have your own lighting equipment. But (a) I don''t have that and (b) that looks too out-of-place, space-taking, and inconsiderate for an event like the Lantern Parade.</li>\n	<li>Unlike a point-and-shoot''s flash, which fires the lights straight at your subject, an SLR fires flash upwards, assuming there is a ceiling to bounce the light downwards, diffused. This results to a better effect/less glare. There obviously isn''t a ceiling equivalent inÂ <i>outdoors</i>, Lanter Parade set-up. I had to use my hands to direct the flash to my subjects (hood it over the flash like a "ceiling" which will quickly catch the lights and bounce it towards your subject). Thank goodness I realized this quickly.</li>\n</ul>\nSo, as it was getting dark at this point, it became harder to get decent shots.

Their first number was the human chain/snake which I believe is part of their initiation rights. Even if it is my second time seeing this, it was still kind of chilling especially with their chant. I heard someone (was he from Î²Ï?) call their second partÂ <i>kata</i>Â which is the Karate equivalent of Taekwondo''sÂ <i>poomsae</i>Â or forms. While their formation and synchronicity might look watch-worthy, it didn''t really catch my attention (maybe ''cause I''ve seen better during my TKD days). So, my eyes were wandering off to better photo-ops, their torch flames in particular. It, however, amuses me that Beta Sigma has their own blend of martial arts.</div>\nA few more lanterns and it was finally the turn of my most anticipated college ever.

And it was starting to get dark. Perfect for pictures like these...\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Melchor Hall, in Lights" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526233267/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Melchor Hall, in Lights" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7141/6526233267_1e8477b2a9.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a title="Lighted Street" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526256373/" target="_blank"><img alt="Lighted Street" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7151/6526256373_e05b77735f.jpg" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a title="Night Settling" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526278629/" target="_blank"><img alt="Night Settling" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7028/6526278629_b3ced09f39.jpg" /></a></p>\r\nAt this point, I learned/realized a few things in photography.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>You really can''t do much if a scene''s lighting is poor to begin with. Not unless you have your own lighting equipment. But (a) I don''t have that and (b) that looks too out-of-place, space-taking, and inconsiderate for an event like the Lantern Parade.</li>\r\n	<li>Unlike a point-and-shoot''s flash, which fires the lights straight at your subject, an SLR fires flash upwards, assuming there is a ceiling to bounce the light downwards, diffused. This results to a better effect/less glare. There obviously isn''t a ceiling equivalent inÂ <i>outdoors</i>, Lanter Parade set-up. I had to use my hands to direct the flash to my subjects (hood it over the flash like a "ceiling" which will quickly catch the lights and bounce it towards your subject). Thank goodness I realized this quickly.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo, as it was getting dark at this point, it became harder to get decent shots. Lighting was no longer on my side as I was already relying on flash. Otherwise, it''d be too dark or too orange depending on where I decide to shoot.\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Wall-E" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526288615/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Wall-E" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7169/6526288615_149dd71673.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a title="The DCS contingent" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526300709/" target="_blank"><img alt="The DCS contingent" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7142/6526300709_5753471da0.jpg" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>Above pictured is Eng''g''s Wall-E, one of our lanterns, and the DCS/Cursor contingent of the Parade. Like last year, Eng''g scored with a particularly awesomazing lantern followed by aâwait for itâ<i><b>boring</b></i>Â march of Eng''g orgs and banners. My sister, who majors in Broadcast Communication, likens it toÂ <i>dead air</i>Â i.e., awkward and should-be-avoided pauses in radio productions. Unlike the last three years though, they, at least, weren''t wearing orange. Plus points for the fashion factor!</div>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Belly Dancers 1" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526312523/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Belly Dancers 1" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7165/6526312523_3940c75595.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a title="Belly Dancers 2" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526328455/" target="_blank"><img alt="Belly Dancers 2" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7002/6526328455_0f3c95ee95.jpg" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a title="The Fire" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526335201/" target="_blank"><img alt="The Fire" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7016/6526335201_9315e7c980.jpg" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>I took this shot from one of the torches of the Beta Sigma frat men. Their first number was the human chain/snake which I believe is part of their initiation rights. Even if it is my second time seeing this, it was still kind of chilling especially with their chant. I heard someone (was he from Î²Ï?) call their second partÂ <i>kata</i>Â which is the Karate equivalent of Taekwondo''sÂ <i>poomsae</i>Â or forms. While their formation and synchronicity might look watch-worthy, it didn''t really catch my attention (maybe ''cause I''ve seen better during my TKD days). So, my eyes were wandering off to better photo-ops, their torch flames in particular. It, however, amuses me that Beta Sigma has their own blend of martial arts.</div>\r\nA few more lanterns and it was finally the turn of my most anticipated college ever.

I was late but it was a nice start to the adventure as I got an opportunity to get a before-the-show feel for the event.\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Camera-Shy Horse" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6524622605/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Camera-Shy Horse" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7020/6524622605_7935d99774.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>This horse is too camera-shy. Everytime I''d point my lens at him he''d turn his head the other way. Maybe he''s proffering me his best angle? Maybe he thinks my lens is some kind of a laser cannon*? This is the best of him I got: snout complete with matchingÂ <i>calesa</i>.</div>\r\nI was happily shooting around Oblation Plaza when I saw our ROTC squad advancing towards Palma Hall. I remembered that they will be one of the first parties to parade. So I hurriedly ended my little photoshoot, reasoning with myself that I need to conserve batteries as I don''t have any spare.\r\n\r\nBut not long after, the beauty of the Carillion took me in...\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Hiding" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6524634145/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Hiding" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7143/6524634145_720489ca93.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a title="The UP Carillion" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6524641123/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="The UP Carillion" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7156/6524641123_db13811fdc.jpg" /></a></p>\r\nWe decided to station ourselves in front of Melchor Hall being that it is at the last leg of the Parade.

And it was starting to get dark. Perfect for pictures like these...\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Melchor Hall, in Lights" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526233267/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Melchor Hall, in Lights" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7141/6526233267_1e8477b2a9.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a title="Lighted Street" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526256373/" target="_blank"><img alt="Lighted Street" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7151/6526256373_e05b77735f.jpg" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a title="Night Settling" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526278629/" target="_blank"><img alt="Night Settling" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7028/6526278629_b3ced09f39.jpg" /></a></p>\r\nAt this point, I learned/realized a few things in photography.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>You really can''t do much if a scene''s lighting is poor to begin with. Not unless you have your own lighting equipment. But (a) I don''t have that and (b) that looks too out-of-place, space-taking, and inconsiderate for an event like the Lantern Parade.</li>\r\n	<li>Unlike a point-and-shoot''s flash, which fires the lights straight at your subject, an SLR fires flash upwards, assuming there is a ceiling to bounce the light downwards, diffused. This results to a better effect/less glare. There obviously isn''t a ceiling equivalent inÂ <i>outdoors</i>, Lanter Parade set-up. I had to use my hands to direct the flash to my subjects (hood it over the flash like a "ceiling" which will quickly catch the lights and bounce it towards your subject). Thank goodness I realized this quickly.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo, as it was getting dark at this point, it became harder to get decent shots. Lighting was no longer on my side as I was already relying on flash. Otherwise, it''d be too dark or too orange depending on where I decide to shoot.\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Wall-E" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526288615/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Wall-E" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7169/6526288615_149dd71673.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a title="The DCS contingent" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526300709/" target="_blank"><img alt="The DCS contingent" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7142/6526300709_5753471da0.jpg" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>Above pictured is Eng''g''s Wall-E, one of our lanterns, and the DCS/Cursor contingent of the Parade. Like last year, Eng''g scored with a particularly awesomazing lantern followed by aâwait for itâ<i><b>boring</b></i>Â march of Eng''g orgs and banners. My sister, who majors in Broadcast Communication, likens it toÂ <i>dead air</i>Â i.e., awkward and should-be-avoided pauses in radio productions. Unlike the last three years though, they, at least, weren''t wearing orange. Plus points for the fashion factor!</div>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Belly Dancers 1" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526312523/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Belly Dancers 1" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7165/6526312523_3940c75595.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a title="Belly Dancers 2" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526328455/" target="_blank"><img alt="Belly Dancers 2" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7002/6526328455_0f3c95ee95.jpg" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a title="The Fire" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526335201/" target="_blank"><img alt="The Fire" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7016/6526335201_9315e7c980.jpg" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>I took this shot from one of the torches of the Beta Sigma frat men. Their first number was the human chain/snake which I believe is part of their initiation rights. Even if it is my second time seeing this, it was still kind of chilling especially with their chant. I heard someone (was he from Î²Ï?) call their second partÂ <i>kata</i>Â which is the Karate equivalent of Taekwondo''sÂ <i>poomsae</i>Â or forms. While their formation and synchronicity might look watch-worthy, it didn''t really catch my attention (maybe ''cause I''ve seen better during my TKD days). So, my eyes were wandering off to better photo-ops, their torch flames in particular. It, however, amuses me that Beta Sigma has their own blend of martial arts.</div>\r\nA few more lanterns and it was finally the turn of my most anticipated college ever.

Not unless you have your own lighting equipment. But (a) I don''t have that and (b) that looks too out-of-place, space-taking, and inconsiderate for an event like the Lantern Parade.</li>\n	<li>Unlike a point-and-shoot''s flash, which fires the lights straight at your subject, an SLR fires flash upwards, assuming there is a ceiling to bounce the light downwards, diffused. This results to a better effect/less glare. There obviously isn''t a ceiling equivalent inÂ <i>outdoors</i>, Lanter Parade set-up. I had to use my hands to direct the flash to my subjects (hood it over the flash like a "ceiling" which will quickly catch the lights and bounce it towards your subject). Thank goodness I realized this quickly.</li>\n</ul>\nSo, as it was getting dark at this point, it became harder to get decent shots. Lighting was no longer on my side as I was already relying on flash. Otherwise, it''d be too dark or too orange depending on where I decide to shoot.\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Wall-E" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526288615/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Wall-E" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7169/6526288615_149dd71673.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\n<a title="The DCS contingent" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526300709/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="The DCS contingent" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7142/6526300709_5753471da0.jpg" /></a>\n<div>Above pictured is Eng''g''s Wall-E, one of our lanterns, and the DCS/Cursor contingent of the Parade.

Their first number was the human chain/snake which I believe is part of their initiation rights. Even if it is my second time seeing this, it was still kind of chilling especially with their chant. I heard someone (was he from Î²Ï?) call their second partÂ <i>kata</i>Â which is the Karate equivalent of Taekwondo''sÂ <i>poomsae</i>Â or forms. While their formation and synchronicity might look watch-worthy, it didn''t really catch my attention (maybe ''cause I''ve seen better during my TKD days). So, my eyes were wandering off to better photo-ops, their torch flames in particular. It, however, amuses me that Beta Sigma has their own blend of martial arts.</div>\nA few more lanterns and it was finally the turn of my most anticipated college ever.

And it was starting to get dark. Perfect for pictures like these...\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Melchor Hall, in Lights" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526233267/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Melchor Hall, in Lights" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7141/6526233267_1e8477b2a9.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\n<a title="Lighted Street" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526256373/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Lighted Street" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7151/6526256373_e05b77735f.jpg" /></a>\n\n<a title="Night Settling" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526278629/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Night Settling" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7028/6526278629_b3ced09f39.jpg" /></a>\n\nAt this point, I learned/realized a few things in photography.\n<ul>\n	<li>You really can''t do much if a scene''s lighting is poor to begin with. Not unless you have your own lighting equipment. But (a) I don''t have that and (b) that looks too out-of-place, space-taking, and inconsiderate for an event like the Lantern Parade.</li>\n	<li>Unlike a point-and-shoot''s flash, which fires the lights straight at your subject, an SLR fires flash upwards, assuming there is a ceiling to bounce the light downwards, diffused. This results to a better effect/less glare. There obviously isn''t a ceiling equivalent inÂ <i>outdoors</i>, Lanter Parade set-up. I had to use my hands to direct the flash to my subjects (hood it over the flash like a "ceiling" which will quickly catch the lights and bounce it towards your subject). Thank goodness I realized this quickly.</li>\n</ul>\nSo, as it was getting dark at this point, it became harder to get decent shots. Lighting was no longer on my side as I was already relying on flash. Otherwise, it''d be too dark or too orange depending on where I decide to shoot.\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Wall-E" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526288615/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Wall-E" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7169/6526288615_149dd71673.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\n<a title="The DCS contingent" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526300709/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="The DCS contingent" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7142/6526300709_5753471da0.jpg" /></a>\n<div>Above pictured is Eng''g''s Wall-E, one of our lanterns, and the DCS/Cursor contingent of the Parade. Like last year, Eng''g scored with a particularly awesomazing lantern followed by aâwait for itâ<i><b>boring</b></i>Â march of Eng''g orgs and banners. My sister, who majors in Broadcast Communication, likens it toÂ <i>dead air</i>Â i.e., awkward and should-be-avoided pauses in radio productions. Unlike the last three years though, they, at least, weren''t wearing orange. Plus points for the fashion factor!</div>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Belly Dancers 1" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526312523/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Belly Dancers 1" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7165/6526312523_3940c75595.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\n<a title="Belly Dancers 2" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526328455/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Belly Dancers 2" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7002/6526328455_0f3c95ee95.jpg" /></a>\n\n<a title="The Fire" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526335201/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="The Fire" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7016/6526335201_9315e7c980.jpg" /></a>\n<div>I took this shot from one of the torches of the Beta Sigma frat men. Their first number was the human chain/snake which I believe is part of their initiation rights. Even if it is my second time seeing this, it was still kind of chilling especially with their chant. I heard someone (was he from Î²Ï?) call their second partÂ <i>kata</i>Â which is the Karate equivalent of Taekwondo''sÂ <i>poomsae</i>Â or forms. While their formation and synchronicity might look watch-worthy, it didn''t really catch my attention (maybe ''cause I''ve seen better during my TKD days). So, my eyes were wandering off to better photo-ops, their torch flames in particular. It, however, amuses me that Beta Sigma has their own blend of martial arts.</div>\nA few more lanterns and it was finally the turn of my most anticipated college ever.

Bought with the advice ofÂ <a href="http://josephacheng.deviantart.com/" target="_blank">Joseph Cheng</a>Â (from DeviantArt). Note that it is different from anÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-lens_reflex_camera" target="_blank">SLR</a>.\r\n\r\n<a title="Getsurikai" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6275204421/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Getsurikai" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6091/6275204421_85349b9e2f.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>This is, incidentally (and probably), the last picture from my old Kodak C913 (whom I haven''t bothered to name) which I''ll post online. It is pictured below.</div>\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6275209901/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="First Shot" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6034/6275209901_a7dd8f5233.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>And this is the first picture Getsurikai ever took (so of course it isn''t really one for aesthetics), barring those which it took when I tested it upon delivery. But I didn''t insert the memory card then so they don''t count *wink*.So long buddy. I''ll miss your compact feel, how I can carry you everyday, except when my bag is too crowded already.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\nI''m not really a fan of anime but I''m quite a huge fan of BLEACH!. Those who know their BLEACH! will know from where did I pattern the name "Getsurikai". It isn''t very clean Japanese from what I''ve been told but hey, I like the sound of it so I''m taking artistic license. And oh, it literally means "moon grasp" by the way.\r\n\r\nThese past few days, I''ve been busy trying to get the feel for it. So far, the biggest adjustment I had to make is the placement of controls. Whereas my old Kodak has all controls at the right-hand side, Getsurikai has it both in the left and right-hand side. Kodak has its shooting mode settings on a dial around the shutter button but that is where Getsurikai has its on/off switch, the shooting modes being in a dial at the left of the viewfinder. Imagine what happened the first time I (instinctively) tried to switch modes? Hooha.\r\n\r\nBut I quickly got over that problem and I''m pretty comfortable with where all the controls are located now. What I''m currently doing is trying to learn all its features before December''sÂ <a title="Year Three" href="http://localhost/skytreader.net/journal/year-three">Lantern Parade</a>, which is, if you need to be made aware, a photographer''s idea of a shooting feast.\r\n\r\nThey''re not much yet but here are some of the results of my test drive.\r\n\r\n<a title="Aperture Experiments" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6275215021/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Aperture Experiments" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6060/6275215021_cbaeea313b.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>Just experimenting with aperture settings...</div>\r\n<a title="Art Found" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6275221317/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Art Found" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6035/6275221317_8dc8fc821e.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>Art found in the construction. We are having house renovations right now (with all this mess, I''m affectionately calling the affair "Voluntary House Demolition"). Interestingly, the carpenters used this amazing artwork to cover a hole they''re digging. I don''t know where did their boss, the Architect, got it though.</div>\r\nThankfully, my room is not involved in the action. I can keep my stuff clean without much effort. Imagine all that dust in my laptop, my external hard drive, and myÂ <i><b>brand-new</b></i>Â camera!.\r\n\r\nMy room got pretty crowded though, since my parents moved in some stuff (like the old desktop which no one uses now except for printing).\r\n\r\n<a title="Windowside Lighting" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6275752054/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Windowside Lighting" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6046/6275752054_1357b002e5.jpg" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a title="Nighttime Window" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6275748842/"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Nighttime Window" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6106/6275748842_fb8f07d032.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>This is my bedside window. Though dark, you''ll still see my bedside lampshade, accomplice whenever I read a book just before going to slumberland. The orange glow comes from the street lamp just outside.</div>\r\nFor so long, I''ve wanted to get that shot. I don''t know when I first wanted it though. I first moved in to my room when I was in Grade Five but I only started taking an interest in photography around Fourth Year high school (four years ago!).\r\n\r\nAnother shot which I''ve wanted to take for so long. Also in my room.\r\n\r\n<a title="A Ceiling of Stars" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6275234551/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="A Ceiling of Stars" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6058/6275234551_efd1e225c7.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>This is my ceiling, just after I hit the switches off at night. This is the sight which I sleep to every night. It doesn''t change depending on the time of the year, nor depending on anything else actually but it can be quite lovely, especially when the lights just turned off and those luminous trappings are fully-charged.It''s not much of a shot (just experimenting with ISO settings) but I''ll re-do this one once the Voluntary House Demolition finishes and I get more space.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\nMy old Kodak actually has pretty good ISO settings; it can go up to 1000. But even with that, all you''ll see is a black screen when you try to take my room @ night pictures.\r\n\r\n<a title="Overgrown" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6275766978/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Overgrown" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6211/6275766978_1f7097cee8.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>I remember, four years ago (!), back in Fourth Year Highschool, when I used to keep a dream journal in my (then-GeoCities) website. I had a particularly refreshing dream involving side walks. I''m pretty sure this one came from that dream.</div>\r\nThat''s all for now. I hope I can get some more practice before the Lantern Parade. And with a schedule like this, I''m pretty optimistic.

Assuming I pass all my subjects this sem (oh pleaseeee!!!), that''s it. They''ll surely give me a CS199 and a CS196 (else, I will raise hell...hehe). Note that CS196 is a one-unit class---I either take it on a Wednesday or on a Friday---so I total 13u away from an undergrad diploma.\r\n\r\nSee you at the Lantern Parade.~Chad', 'Hey Kids!

I made it a point to bring my umbrella, for Getsurikai''s sake. Thank heavens I had no need for it.\r\n\r\nI arrived at UP late by my standards. For the past three years, I''d usually arrive before lunch then hang out for some hours, reading a book I brought, until my friends start texting me, asking where in UP am I. I''d do that to avoid being hassled by the traffic caused by the Parade. For some reason the traffic-hassle didn''t give me enough incentive to get-up early this year. I was late but it was a nice start to the adventure as I got an opportunity to get a before-the-show feel for the event.\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Camera-Shy Horse" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6524622605/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Camera-Shy Horse" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7020/6524622605_7935d99774.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<div>This horse is too camera-shy. Everytime I''d point my lens at him he''d turn his head the other way. Maybe he''s proffering me his best angle? Maybe he thinks my lens is some kind of a laser cannon*? This is the best of him I got: snout complete with matchingÂ <i>calesa</i>.</div>\r\nI was happily shooting around Oblation Plaza when I saw our ROTC squad advancing towards Palma Hall. I remembered that they will be one of the first parties to parade. So I hurriedly ended my little photoshoot, reasoning with myself that I need to conserve batteries as I don''t have any spare.\r\n\r\nBut not long after, the beauty of the Carillion took me in...\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Hiding" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6524634145/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Hiding" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7143/6524634145_720489ca93.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\r\n<a title="The UP Carillion" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6524641123/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="The UP Carillion" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7156/6524641123_db13811fdc.jpg" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe decided to station ourselves in front of Melchor Hall being that it is at the last leg of the Parade. Last leg == night time (eventually) == more awesome for the lovely lantern lights.\r\n\r\nThat said, with all my hurrying, we still had lots of idle time when our group was finally completed.

And it was starting to get dark. Perfect for pictures like these...\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Melchor Hall, in Lights" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526233267/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Melchor Hall, in Lights" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7141/6526233267_1e8477b2a9.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\r\n<a title="Lighted Street" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526256373/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Lighted Street" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7151/6526256373_e05b77735f.jpg" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a title="Night Settling" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526278629/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Night Settling" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7028/6526278629_b3ced09f39.jpg" /></a>\r\n\r\nAt this point, I learned/realized a few things in photography.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>You really can''t do much if a scene''s lighting is poor to begin with. Not unless you have your own lighting equipment. But (a) I don''t have that and (b) that looks too out-of-place, space-taking, and inconsiderate for an event like the Lantern Parade.</li>\r\n	<li>Unlike a point-and-shoot''s flash, which fires the lights straight at your subject, an SLR fires flash upwards, assuming there is a ceiling to bounce the light downwards, diffused. This results to a better effect/less glare. There obviously isn''t a ceiling equivalent inÂ <i>outdoors</i>, Lanter Parade set-up. I had to use my hands to direct the flash to my subjects (hood it over the flash like a "ceiling" which will quickly catch the lights and bounce it towards your subject). Thank goodness I realized this quickly.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo, as it was getting dark at this point, it became harder to get decent shots. Lighting was no longer on my side as I was already relying on flash. Otherwise, it''d be too dark or too orange depending on where I decide to shoot.\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Wall-E" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526288615/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Wall-E" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7169/6526288615_149dd71673.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\r\n<a title="The DCS contingent" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526300709/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="The DCS contingent" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7142/6526300709_5753471da0.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>Above pictured is Eng''g''s Wall-E, one of our lanterns, and the DCS/Cursor contingent of the Parade. Like last year, Eng''g scored with a particularly awesomazing lantern followed by aâwait for itâ<i><b>boring</b></i>Â march of Eng''g orgs and banners. My sister, who majors in Broadcast Communication, likens it toÂ <i>dead air</i>Â i.e., awkward and should-be-avoided pauses in radio productions. Unlike the last three years though, they, at least, weren''t wearing orange.

Their first number was the human chain/snake which I believe is part of their initiation rights. Even if it is my second time seeing this, it was still kind of chilling especially with their chant. I heard someone (was he from Î²Ï?) call their second partÂ <i>kata</i>Â which is the Karate equivalent of Taekwondo''sÂ <i>poomsae</i>Â or forms. While their formation and synchronicity might look watch-worthy, it didn''t really catch my attention (maybe ''cause I''ve seen better during my TKD days).

And it was starting to get dark. Perfect for pictures like these...\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Melchor Hall, in Lights" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526233267/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Melchor Hall, in Lights" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7141/6526233267_1e8477b2a9.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\r\n<a title="Lighted Street" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526256373/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Lighted Street" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7151/6526256373_e05b77735f.jpg" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a title="Night Settling" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526278629/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Night Settling" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7028/6526278629_b3ced09f39.jpg" /></a>\r\n\r\nAt this point, I learned/realized a few things in photography.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>You really can''t do much if a scene''s lighting is poor to begin with. Not unless you have your own lighting equipment. But (a) I don''t have that and (b) that looks too out-of-place, space-taking, and inconsiderate for an event like the Lantern Parade.</li>\r\n	<li>Unlike a point-and-shoot''s flash, which fires the lights straight at your subject, an SLR fires flash upwards, assuming there is a ceiling to bounce the light downwards, diffused. This results to a better effect/less glare. There obviously isn''t a ceiling equivalent inÂ <i>outdoors</i>, Lanter Parade set-up. I had to use my hands to direct the flash to my subjects (hood it over the flash like a "ceiling" which will quickly catch the lights and bounce it towards your subject). Thank goodness I realized this quickly.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo, as it was getting dark at this point, it became harder to get decent shots. Lighting was no longer on my side as I was already relying on flash. Otherwise, it''d be too dark or too orange depending on where I decide to shoot.\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Wall-E" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526288615/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Wall-E" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7169/6526288615_149dd71673.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\r\n<a title="The DCS contingent" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526300709/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="The DCS contingent" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7142/6526300709_5753471da0.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>Above pictured is Eng''g''s Wall-E, one of our lanterns, and the DCS/Cursor contingent of the Parade. Like last year, Eng''g scored with a particularly awesomazing lantern followed by aâwait for itâ<i><b>boring</b></i>Â march of Eng''g orgs and banners. My sister, who majors in Broadcast Communication, likens it toÂ <i>dead air</i>Â i.e., awkward and should-be-avoided pauses in radio productions. Unlike the last three years though, they, at least, weren''t wearing orange. Plus points for the fashion factor!</div>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Belly Dancers 1" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526312523/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Belly Dancers 1" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7165/6526312523_3940c75595.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>\r\n<a title="Belly Dancers 2" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526328455/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Belly Dancers 2" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7002/6526328455_0f3c95ee95.jpg" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a title="The Fire" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/6526335201/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="The Fire" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7016/6526335201_9315e7c980.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>I took this shot from one of the torches of the Beta Sigma frat men. Their first number was the human chain/snake which I believe is part of their initiation rights. Even if it is my second time seeing this, it was still kind of chilling especially with their chant. I heard someone (was he from Î²Ï?) call their second partÂ <i>kata</i>Â which is the Karate equivalent of Taekwondo''sÂ <i>poomsae</i>Â or forms. While their formation and synchronicity might look watch-worthy, it didn''t really catch my attention (maybe ''cause I''ve seen better during my TKD days). So, my eyes were wandering off to better photo-ops, their torch flames in particular. It, however, amuses me that Beta Sigma has their own blend of martial arts.</div>\r\nA few more lanterns and it was finally the turn of my most anticipated college ever.

I am grateful to this idea for not running away and reminding me of itself in my time of greatest need. After all, I''ve held it inside my head for almost a year now. This idea presented itself to me while I am in a math class. I don''t know why, of all places, did it appear to me in a math class. I guess that just goes to testify that boring lectures really do hound me left and right. (Note to self: I didn''t find Math53 boring at all. Of all my maths it is the one I enjoyed best so far).\n\nFor the first three days of November, I''ve written more than the daily target word count. But on the fourth day enrollment kicked in, opposing my momentum with such vehement force. Now, every second is an essential second as I try to get ahead of schedule once more. I''m not gunning to write the next bestseller. I just want to write. In any case I am sure thatÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_(series)">something</a>Â will always be worse than the product of my one-month writing frenzy. (Note to self: Remind me to cheat the NaNoWriMo word count validator AI and paste this blog entry alongside my novel. To rack up my word count of course!)\n\nAnd now we turn toÂ <i>the</i>Â November News worthÂ <del>bragging</del>Â blogging about...\n\nIt isn''t news that I am such aÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_(Vertigo)">Sandman</a>Â fan. That little tribute I have (reinstated) in my homepage isn''t new; I once had it adorning the headers of a dream journal.\n\nNeedless to say, Sandman is too costly a leisure for my limited finances. And UP students aren''t really known for being rich. I entered UP with only three copies of Neil Gaiman''s acclaimed work.\n\n[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="614"]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4082325263/"><img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2496/4082325263_159ce0ee1f_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a> My Sandman Library, before I entered UP. (L-R) Dream Country, Season of Mists, A Game of You.[/caption]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBack in high school, aside from not having enough finances for my Sandman Library, there is also the matter of Sandman proximity: no nearby bookshop that I know of sold Sandman stuff.\n\nAnd now, in college, aside from bragging rights, my University affords me access to one-jeepney-away malls with bookshops selling Sandman books. Lucky me. As my freshman year ended, my Sandman Library doubled in size.\n\n[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="614"]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4083088472/"><img alt="" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3478/4083088472_d3bcc4ddbe_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a> My Sandman Library, post First Year. (L-R) Row I: Dream Country, Season of Mists, A Game of You. Row II: The Dream Hunters, Preludes and Nocturnes, The Sandman King of Dreams.[/caption]\n\n<i>Dream Hunters</i>, that golden book at the lower-left corner, is a spin-off volume penned by Neil Gaiman in celebration of a Sandman anniversary. This book, unlike the "canonical" ten-volume series, isn''t a comic book; it is a novel, richly clad with illustrations from Yoshitaka Amano, of Final Fantasy fame. The black one at the lower-right corner, differs with the rest of the books in this picture as it isn''t really a brainchild of Gaiman. It isn''t even a story.Â <i>The Sandman King of Dreams</i>Â is a book by Alisa Kwitney, third assistant editor of theÂ <i>Sandman</i>Â series, which is more or less like a guide/behind the scenes to the ten-volume epic.\n\nAnd then there is the matter of a little-known story regarding my summer class adventure. I''ve talked about my first encounter with Physics hell but not about this one. Not that I haven''t talked about it at all; I tell the people I encounter about my fantastic discovery and, in the process, realize how too few people know how expensive books can get.\n\nIn UP, it isn''t surprising to encounter book stands at any time of the year, at any corner of the campus. Most of these book stands sell books you won''t find in bookstores: from books censored due to extreme (usually leftist) radicalism to books that bookstores don''t sell just because the book concerned is way past its sell-time prime, to books you won''t find in bookstores because they are already too old and dusty for colorful shelves. I am not much a fan of them but every once in a while I find a book I really like on their displays.\n\nThese book stands come and go, which is really inconvenient should you find a book you''ve been really looking for in their displays but will not have the money for it until next week. You return next week only to find an empty spot in the place where the book stand should''ve been. You despair for the missed chance and maybe curse off the delicious lunch which drained your pockets last week, before you encountered the book of your dreams.\n\nAnd then there is that book stand along AS Walk which I, for the sake of having something to refer to, will baptize asÂ <i>Manong''s Mega Book Stand</i>.\n\nI encounteredÂ <i>Manong''s Mega Book Stand</i>Â just last summer. As I am not a very huge fan of book stands I came in just wanting to have good look around, just in case I get that rareÂ <i>Eureka!</i>Â moment that I find a book there that I can''t find elsewhere.\n\nThe moment I stepped in, I realized the difference betweenÂ <i>Manong''s Mega Book Stand</i>Â and all the other book stands instantly for there, on the shelves ofÂ <i>Manong''s Mega Book Stand</i>Â stood a decent number of books I would really like to have on my personal library. And they are sold in prices way cheaper than their book store counterparts.\n\nFrom memory,Â <i>Manong''s Mega Book Stand</i>Â has the following books:\n<ul>\n	<li>Books by Arturo Perez-Reverte, especially some of the books in hisÂ <i>Capitan Alatriste</i>Â series.</li>\n	<li>Books on Philosophy.</li>\n	<li>Books by Salman Rushdie.</li>\n	<li>Collections ofÂ <i>The Far Side</i>Â comics.</li>\n	<li>Graphic novels (I distinctly rememberÂ <i>Watchmen</i>)</li>\n	<li>Graphic novels by Neil Gaiman (that is to say, graphic novels ofÂ <i>Neverwhere</i>,Â <i>Stardust</i>,Â <i>Black Orchid</i>, possibly more that I just can''t remember. And yes, "Graphic novels by Neil Gaiman" also means the<b>complete</b>Â <i>Sandman</i>Â series).</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nI do not know ifÂ <i>Manong''s Mega Book Stand</i>Â still has the completeÂ <i>Sandman</i>Â series. After all,Â <b><i>I already have, in my book shelves, a good majority of them</i></b>. Thanks toÂ <i>Manong''s Mega Book Stand</i>, I have already completed my Sandman Library.\n\n[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="461"]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/4082331133/"><img alt="" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3534/4082331133_7d36cb9a2a_b.jpg" width="461" height="614" /></a> My Sandman Library circa November 5, 2009.

I''m also a huge fan of Neil Gaiman (and his epic, <i>The Sandman</i>). From Rowling and Gaiman, I picked up a whole slew of other authors to read like Lovecraft, Funke, and Lewis.\r\n\r\nThe literature course I took in college introduced me to a whole bunch of other authors. I did not appreciate everything in our reading list for that class but, among those I did, I ended up being fond of Italo Calvino and Arturo Perez-Reverte. Reading discussions about their work made me curious about other authors such as Umberto Eco and Aldous Huxley. Perez-Reverte made me check out other thrillers like Elizabeth Kostova''sÂ <em>The Historian</em> and Graham Moore''sÂ <em>The Sherlockian</em> ((If you managed to deduce that I''ve also read all the canonical Holmes stories, congrats!)).\r\n<h2>I''m a writer</h2>\r\n<h2>I''m a photodocumanitarian</h2>\r\n<h2>I''m a maker</h2>', 'Stuff I Do', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '13-revision-4', '', '', '2012-12-29 10:13:55', '2012-12-29 10:13:55', '', 13, 'http://localhost/skytreader.net/journal/13-revision-4', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

It rained before the parade started. Maybe there''s something with the water that broke down part of the spirit.\r\n\r\nThe Parade went as usual for the early part, with people crowding over this lantern and that. But as it wore the lantern lines broke in segments and it wasn''t very exciting anymore. And there was too much ideology involved. Not that you can wash that entirely away from something so UP. But, again, too much compared to my previous two.\r\n\r\nBut then I over speak. A post about the Lantern Parade is a post of pictures, of course. So here they are.\r\n\r\n<a title="An Early Drizzle" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5271652738/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="An Early Drizzle" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5086/5271652738_9738799c67.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>An early drizzle, which soaked the grounds as well as the AS steps, the effect being that those who opted to watch at the AS steps spent the night standing (or so my sister tells me). Which makes me wonder why...</div>\r\n<a title="Why are they sitting down?" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5270509770/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Why are they sitting down?" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5245/5270509770_7d036868de.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>...are they sitting down, here at the Engineering steps? Sure some of them had monoblocks and other what-have-you''s for dry sitting-down but most of them had none. And they sat down, monoblock or no monoblock.</div>\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5269898743/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5128/5269898743_c0bc4bc634.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\nAnyway, this was CSSP''s lantern/float before it rained. I don''t know what''s up with CSSP this year but they seem to be in a particularly celebratory mood; they even had sportsfests and pageants (a la Miss Eng''g, in my opinion) this year. Whatever the celebration may be, cheers to them.\r\n\r\nSee those crayons? They melted thanks to the rain, so unlike real crayons which melts with fire, not water.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<a title="Pouncing Zebra" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5270538088/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Pouncing Zebra" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5168/5270538088_9ee1c0ec79.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div><b>Aside:</b>Â This zebra is so cute. There were other balloons of this kind there, from SpongeBob to Dora, but I only managed to take the picture of this zebra. I''m not very fine with the lighting for this one but according to my sister, this shot is the cutest. Here are some more shots (whose lighting I like but are not very favored with my sister in terms of the cuteness factor).</div>\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5271447817/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5247/5271447817_2f5eab0d1b.jpg" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5271440689/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5168/5271440689_4dd35807d6.jpg" /></a>\r\n\r\nAn early show stealer is our very own Pep Squad. I can''t do their awesomeness justice just by telling you what. And no picture, even one worth a million words, can tell you what poetry their motion wrote.

I think some of them was more driven by ideology than by art.\r\n\r\nEngineering---my college---was a big let down, I''m afraid. It started with a particularly crowd-whoa-drawing contraption which looked like a horse''s skeleton with a rider too small for it at the top. Then the rider pedals the bike and the contraption moves and the crowd is amazed. It was followed by electronic (read: Earth-friendly) jeepneys. And then a long march of Engineering organizations which didn''t display anything much aside from orange shirts courtesy of Meralco and org banners.\r\n\r\nUpon entering UP, our Dean then told us the story behind our College''s Lantern Parade performance. There was a time when no one gave much damn on our lantern. Then she gave the ultimatum that, if our Lantern Parade performance remains lackluster, Eng''g Week* won''t be held next year. And the rest is, as they say, history. I don''t know how true this story is, me being unaffliated, but I think it is time to amend that order to something that will require the orgs to show something worth watching. Just my two cents.\r\n\r\nAnyway, we jump to the show stealers of always, the ever-awesome College of Fine Arts.\r\n\r\nI can''t help but feel that their parade is shorter than usual this year. I didn''t see any of the people I know in Fine Arts. But still, they''re awesome.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5270521654/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5290/5270521654_4c809edb4f.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>It''s not much of a shot on my part but this style of lantern is something I find so nice.</div>\r\n<a title="King Blastoise Waving" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5269917513/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="King Blastoise Waving" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5242/5269917513_38b5bdb528.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>King Blastoise you''re so awesome and you''re waving at me!</div>\r\nI''ll tell you a secret and please make sure that King Blastoise here won''t know ''cause he''s so freaking awesome I wouldn''t want to anger him. Back in those days when I spent the day beeping on my high-tech Tamagochi that is Pokemon in the GameBoy Color, I''m not really a very huge Blastoise (or, for that matter, water-type) fan. I''m more the fire type kind of trainer. When Oak/Elm asks me to choose, I always chose Charmander/Cyndaquil which eventually evolves to Charizard/Typhloshion. And then my rival will choose the water-type, Squirtle/Totodile, which grows to Blastoise/Feraligatr. And you know what? I always beat my rival despite the type advantage. I always hard-boiled Squirtle/Wartortle/Blastoise in his shell. Even if he beats me, I''d turn the GameBoy off without saving so that my loss is technically non-existent. Then I''d turn it back on and train some more before having another go at cooking some hard-boiled pokemon. Now you know why I wouldn''t like King Blastoise to know.\r\n\r\n<a title="Gyarados Cometh!" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5270528474/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Gyarados Cometh!" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5161/5270528474_e6bd85cc68.jpg" /></a>\r\n<div>You didn''t tell King Blastoise?

Yee-ha.\r\n\r\n(According to Sir Pros, our adviser,Â <i>thesis</i>Â is, by definition, something you do alone. But for all intents and purposes, ourÂ <i>special problem</i>, usually done in pairs or in threes even in other labs, can be considered a thesis.)\r\n\r\n''Till next month! ~The Chad Estioco', 'Photograph(s) of the Month: Roses', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'photographs-of-the-month-roses', '', '', '2012-12-29 17:01:50', '2012-12-29 17:01:50', '', 0, 'http://localhost/skytreader.net/?p=85', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Despite calling you my "main" blog I am aware that you are probably jealous at howÂ <a href="http://kodeplay.skytreader.net/" target="_blank">kode.play</a>Â hogged all my attention this past summer. It was unavoidable, being that I had to blog about my internship and that the posts created were inevitably technical in nature. But it''s over now.\r\n\r\nI''m not sure that the posts will be back to my normal one-post-per-month quota though. I''ll be doing my thesis/special problem this year. And have I told you that, through some turn events, I''ll be doing this solo flight? (<i>Anak ng...</i>special problemÂ <i>nga</i>) This early on, I''m taking leave that I may miss more posts.\r\n\r\n(But wait! I got a back-up plan. In anticipation of some middle-term plan I''m hatching, I''ll be posting, instead of my usual tirade of words, a photograph of the month, taken by yours truly. That should be pretty easy for me to meet and squeeze in a schedule expected to be full eh?)\r\n\r\nI never really planned to do my thesis solo. Maybe I did but that was only at the start of my college career; when I saw how chaotic things can get I started considering doing it with a group, a consideration I held on to until I received the email welcoming me to the research lab I applied to. My name was there, at the top, alone in it''s line, unaccompanied by those whom I contacted as group matesâa solo flight ticket. "Chad," says Neil, a gifted artist I hang around with, "if you need a crying shoulder anytime this coming year, we''re here."\r\n\r\nIn my renewed sense of optimism and belief in reasons reason does not know, I can''t help but feel that doing my thesis alone is a challenge especially meant for me. Back in high school, I always dreamed of the time I get to make a system on my own, large enough to make a decent dent on a CD''s 700MB worth of storage space. I don''t know how large do theses get but I''m pretty sure I''ll be exceeding the line count of the spaghetti behind<a href="http://gradegrid.skytreader.net/" target="_blank">GradeGrid</a>Â or the 1087 lines of code behind the programming language I created for my Programming Laguages class. Well, here''s my shot at immortality, I say.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://skytreader.net/journal/announcing-an-adventure">Months back</a>, I said that my internship will probably be the longest three units of my life. Over atÂ <a href="http://kodeplay.skytreader.net/2011/05/28/andreis-awesomely-amazing-android-adventure-at-azeus/" target="_blank">{kode.play();}</a>*, I have a record of how many hours did I spend for my internship. I clocked in around 281 hours and 52 minutes in around 7 weeks. I created a timer program that will keep track of how many hours do I spend working on something, inspired by an internal tool from Azeus. I''ll be timing how much time will I spend on my thesis. Anyone wants to bet as to which will be longer, internship or thesis?\r\n<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5823237029/" target="_blank"><img alt="Beauty Unnoticed" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3257/5823237029_66ac946d6c.jpg" width="500" /></a></div>\r\nStay beautiful, it''s a new beginning ~ The Chad Estioco\r\n\r\n*Yep, I changed the styling of kode.play, to make it more geeeky.

(100, 1, '2011-04-10 16:43:13', '2011-04-10 16:43:13', 'There I told you. It''d happen again. I passed my blog entry for March but, in summary, March was a month of code and that is a probable understatement. Not only did I have to type through lines and lines and lines of code but I also had to read through heaps and heaps of readings and solve past systems and systems of equations. But it was a fun month though don''t ask me if I''d like to have another go at it.\r\n\r\nThis summer smells of code as well. Ever since I entered college I forsook my right to have summer vacations. My "vacation" will mostly be around a week after I submit the last second sem requirement and then around 2-3 weeks after I submit the last summer term requirement, depending on when next academic year''s first semester will start.\r\n\r\nI''ve never taken a CS class on summers mainly because they aren''t always offered. But that is not to say that I haven''t coded on summers. I remember, the summer after my first year, how I tried to run through the problems atÂ <a href="http://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank">Project Euler</a>, brushing up my Schemer skills in the process.

I passed my blog entry for March but, in summary, March was a month of code and that is a probable understatement. Not only did I have to type through lines and lines and lines of code but I also had to read through heaps and heaps of readings and solve past systems and systems of equations. But it was a fun month though don''t ask me if I''d like to have another go at it.\n\nThis summer smells of code as well. Ever since I entered college I forsook my right to have summer vacations. My "vacation" will mostly be around a week after I submit the last second sem requirement and then around 2-3 weeks after I submit the last summer term requirement, depending on when next academic year''s first semester will start.\n\nI''ve never taken a CS class on summers mainly because they aren''t always offered. But that is not to say that I haven''t coded on summers. I remember, the summer after my first year, how I tried to run through the problems atÂ <a href="http://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank">Project Euler</a>, brushing up my Schemer skills in the process.

Despite calling you my "main" blog I am aware that you are probably jealous at howÂ <a href="http://kodeplay.skytreader.net/" target="_blank">kode.play</a>Â hogged all my attention this past summer. It was unavoidable, being that I had to blog about my internship and that the posts created were inevitably technical in nature. But it''s over now.\n\nI''m not sure that the posts will be back to my normal one-post-per-month quota though. I''ll be doing my thesis/special problem this year. And have I told you that, through some turn events, I''ll be doing this solo flight? (<i>Anak ng...</i>special problemÂ <i>nga</i>) This early on, I''m taking leave that I may miss more posts.\n\n(But wait! I got a back-up plan. In anticipation of some middle-term plan I''m hatching, I''ll be posting, instead of my usual tirade of words, a photograph of the month, taken by yours truly. That should be pretty easy for me to meet and squeeze in a schedule expected to be full eh?)\n\nI never really planned to do my thesis solo. Maybe I did but that was only at the start of my college career; when I saw how chaotic things can get I started considering doing it with a group, a consideration I held on to until I received the email welcoming me to the research lab I applied to. My name was there, at the top, alone in it''s line, unaccompanied by those whom I contacted as group matesâa solo flight ticket. "Chad," says Neil, a gifted artist I hang around with, "if you need a crying shoulder anytime this coming year, we''re here."\n\nIn my renewed sense of optimism and belief in reasons reason does not know, I can''t help but feel that doing my thesis alone is a challenge especially meant for me. Back in high school, I always dreamed of the time I get to make a system on my own, large enough to make a decent dent on a CD''s 700MB worth of storage space. I don''t know how large do theses get but I''m pretty sure I''ll be exceeding the line count of the spaghetti behind<a href="http://gradegrid.skytreader.net/" target="_blank">GradeGrid</a>Â or the 1087 lines of code behind the programming language I created for my Programming Laguages class. Well, here''s my shot at immortality, I say.\n\n<a href="http://skytreader.net/journal/announcing-an-adventure">Months back</a>, I said that my internship will probably be the longest three units of my life. Over atÂ <a href="http://kodeplay.skytreader.net/2011/05/28/andreis-awesomely-amazing-android-adventure-at-azeus/" target="_blank">{kode.play();}</a>*, I have a record of how many hours did I spend for my internship. I clocked in around 281 hours and 52 minutes in around 7 weeks. I created a timer program that will keep track of how many hours do I spend working on something, inspired by an internal tool from Azeus. I''ll be timing how much time will I spend on my thesis. Anyone wants to bet as to which will be longer, internship or thesis?\n<div align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lokisky_walker/5823237029/" target="_blank"><img alt="Beauty Unnoticed" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3257/5823237029_66ac946d6c.jpg" width="500" /></a></div>\nStay beautiful, it''s a new beginning ~ The Chad Estioco\n\n*Yep, I changed the styling of kode.play, to make it more geeeky.

Yay.\n\nI know that rosesâlike books, butterflies, and heartsâare fragile things but I never knew that they are that delicate that it is quite a task keeping them alive.

If you head over to myÂ <a href="http://chadestioco.deviantart.com/" target="_blank">DeviantArt</a>Â you''ll see lot''s of flower pics in there. I find flowers that beautiful that I can''t stop myself from taking pictures when I see some interesting onesâwhich scares me a bit. I guess it''s every artist''s fear that he has ran out of new ideas to try, that his recurring themes are no more than reused cliche. Where do you draw the line between recurring themes and loss of fresh ideas?\n\nBut hey this post is supposed to be happy. In other news, I''m no longer doing my thesis/special problem alone. I''m with two ladies and we''re working onÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porites" target="_blank">Porites</a>Â a genus of corals. More about the problem as we progress.

I remember kicking softdrink tin cans with friends way back in elementary, being that we had no Football equipment and that softdrink tin cans were just perfect in weight if not in shape. Even as relatives and teachers thought I''d be playing Basketball due to my growth spurt when I was young, I kept dreaming of green fields and goals.\r\n\r\nMy elementary school had no varsity teams. So, when I moved to a new school for high school, I really looked forward to playing a sport. But alas, the high school I moved to had varsity teams, alright, but not Football.

I remember kicking softdrink tin cans with friends way back in elementary, being that we had no Football equipment and that softdrink tin cans were just perfect in weight if not in shape. Even as relatives and teachers thought I''d be playing Basketball due to my growth spurt when I was young, I kept dreaming of green fields and goals.\r\n\r\nMy elementary school had no varsity teams.

And then the next few days became quite amusing, as people learned that I celebrated my birthday on the 8th. People wrote me uber-interesting greetings, starkly personal, if I may say, even if not by Facebook standards, going well up to a week after my actual birthday.

The moment you learn that you have received an invitation, you get so excited you''d want to jump straight in. And jump straight in you do, not minding the initial discouragement provided by long queues. Your body makes a cold splash into the surface and underneath you go. The water is cool. You smile in between segments of underwater respiration. You cherish the smooth feel the enveloping water gives. Wonderful.\n\nAnd when your lungful of air is over, you break through the film of the surface once more, this time around attacking it from below. You look back and you realize that you''re already quite far from the shore. Must''ve been quite a dive eh? Then someone taps you and points forward. You see sharks. You try to turn back but then this person who pointed the sharks points to a sign saying "No swimming backwards". Most likely, your parents are sitting near this sign as well, egging you on. You look at the sharks. You look at the sign. Repeat until satisfied. Repeat until you arrive at the conclusion that there is no other way but to get out of this pool in the proper state, id est, unmangled by the sharks and still breathing, still capable of continuing LIFE. This is where you realize that your initial excitement is nothing but the manifestation of hidden feelings of self-hatred and disgust stemming from the sociopathic urges you''ve had and repressed as a child. Not wonderful.\n\nIf my imagery allows, Physics is like another pool inside this UP-pool. Physics IS NOT a shark. It is another pool (inside this this pool, yes) which you are just so excited to toss yourself into at first glance but realize that you want to get out of this freaking hell alive as soon as possible. Erm no...Physics is an eddy current that seemed wonderful at first sight, further reinforcing the conclusion that your initial excitement is nothing but the manifestation of hidden feelings of self-hatred and disgust stemming from the sociopathic urges you''ve had and repressed as a child. Who else, aside from an atoning sociopath, would find the idea of tossing himself into an eddy current exciting? Dante shouldn''t have bothered describing the grotesque, the disgusting. He should''ve made them study Physics.\n\nDespite that, Physics remains to be a wonderful foil for our intuition as well as for mathematical induction. Mathematical induction won''t always work in Physics. Mathematical induction is a poor way to conclude your experiments in Physics. Physics defies first impressions and base cases.\n\nPhysics is one of the things we should be thankful for. When was the last time you thanked gravity for rain fall? I thank friction for making rappelling possible, angular momentum for spinning kicks and electronics for computers. One of the good things inside this eddy current is that you get the right perspective to appreciate these simple gifts from natural laws.\n\n[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="614"]<a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2515/3848374032_a667e10575_b.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2515/3848374032_a667e10575_b.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a> Thank you friction![/caption]\n\n<hr noshade="noshade" />\n\nWhat is the direction of the induced electric field in the reference frame of the rod shown in the figure at the right?\n<ol type="a">\n	<li>Up<a href="http://localhost/skytreader.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/physics_diagram.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-106" alt="physics_diagram" src="http://localhost/skytreader.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/physics_diagram.jpg" width="188" height="181" /></a></li>\n	<li>Into the page</li>\n	<li>Out of the page</li>\n	<li>To the left</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\n<hr noshade="noshade" />\n\nNonetheless, with all the gratitude it makes me realize, I must admit that Physics is one subject that I''d like to get done with as soon as possible.

Just give me time to kick the hell out of the coming hell weeks...\r\n\r\nThere is one productivity trick that I''ve learned from my internship which I''ve continued to apply even well after I''m out of it: plan aheadÂ <i>not</i>Â what you want to do but what you want toÂ <i>achieve</i>. This has been largely responsible why the past midterm season went by me without much hassle on my part. Ever since my internship, I''ve started my weeks planning ahead what I want to achieve and then tallying myself. I try to achieve at least 70% of the goals I set weekly and I''m pretty good at it; I usually get my 70% done, until recently, that is.\r\n\r\nBut before I proceed telling you about what''s been keeping me busy this past few weeks, allow me to backtrack a little and relate an interesting event I forgot to relate and that happened all because of my birthday last month. In an age where Facebook has kindly been reminding everyone of everyone else''s birthday, I pusposedly set my account to tell no one when my birthday is. As I expected, I didn''t get much greetings on my birthday. I had maybe around 3, all coming in at the last minute of August 8, two through Facebook and one via text message. And then the next few days became quite amusing, as people learned that I celebrated my birthday on the 8th. People wrote me uber-interesting greetings, starkly personal, if I may say, even if not by Facebook standards, going well up to a week after my actual birthday. True enough, I didn''t get as much greetings than if I allowed my birthday alarm to ring but I''m pretty sure that I got the better deal by receiving messages that is not the generic "Happy Birthday Chad! &lt;maybe insert smiley here&gt;".\r\n\r\nAnyway...so, what I''ve been up to. These past few weeks, my 70%-goal-achievement productivity saw a sharp drop as I found myself alternating only between two interesting projects: my thesis and my EEE8 project. This is my second take on EEE8; I don''t think I was able to tell the blog that I failed it last year largely because it was eclipsed by more personal failures, which took center stage in my posts. Back then, I never thought I''d ever even be remotely interested in breadboards, integrated circuits, and wires. But well, here I am, thinking of how can I build a robot to automate the cleaning process of my room.\r\n\r\nAs for my thesis, I must admit that one of the many reasons I wanted to join UPD''s Computer Vision and Machine Intelligence Group (CVMIG) was because I knew that I''d probably be working on image processing, which was, back in high school my idea of the pinnacle of programming. Well I got my wish, but that is not to say that I am not having a hard time in the task set to us. For some weeks now, I''ve been contemplating over theÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabor_filter" target="_blank">Gabor filter</a>Â and I must say that I''m still pretty far from what I hope I''ve achieved with it already.\r\n\r\nWell, that''s all for now. Wish me luck and see you soon in Paradise, wherever or whatever that is...~Your Skymeister.\r\n\r\n<a href="http://localhost/skytreader.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/heaven.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-115" alt="heaven" src="http://localhost/skytreader.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/heaven.jpg" width="704" height="490" /></a>', 'Photography of the Month: Reach Up to Paradise', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '114-revision-2', '', '', '2012-12-29 17:20:10', '2012-12-29 17:20:10', '', 114, 'http://localhost/skytreader.net/journal/114-revision-2', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

I blog about what I code and what I shoot.\r\n<h2>I''m a reader</h2>\r\nYep. Perhaps one of my earliest passions. Like most people my age, I''m a huge fan of J.K. Rowling''s Harry Potter. I''m also a huge fan of Neil Gaiman (and his epic, <i>The Sandman</i>). From Rowling and Gaiman, I picked up a whole slew of other authors to read like Lovecraft, Funke, and Lewis.\r\n\r\nThe literature course I took in college introduced me to a whole bunch of other authors. I did not appreciate everything in our reading list for that class but, among those I did, I ended up being fond of Italo Calvino and Arturo Perez-Reverte. Reading discussions about their work made me curious about other authors such as Umberto Eco and Aldous Huxley. Perez-Reverte made me check out other thrillers like Elizabeth Kostova''sÂ <em>The Historian</em> and Graham Moore''sÂ <em>The Sherlockian</em> ((If you managed to deduce that I''ve also read all the canonical Holmes stories, congrats!)).\r\n<h2>I''m a writer</h2>\r\n<h2>I''m a photodocumanitarian</h2>\r\n<h2>I''m a maker</h2>', 'Stuff I Do', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '13-revision-5', '', '', '2012-12-29 15:54:29', '2012-12-29 15:54:29', '', 13, 'http://localhost/skytreader.net/journal/13-revision-5', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
